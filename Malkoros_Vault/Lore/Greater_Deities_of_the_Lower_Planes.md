# Greater Deities of the Lower Planes

Azhadûn, the Crimson Warden – Greater God of Tyranny, Contracts, and Damnation
Symbol: A spired crown impaled through a scroll of binding chains
Granted Powers: Devils gain immunity to fire and poison damage. They may invoke Hellish Rebuke once per long rest, and their contracts can bind souls with divine sanction across all planes unless explicitly warded.
Allowed Alignments: Lawful Evil only
Azhadûn is the creator and sovereign of the Nine Hells — the vast infernal hierarchy of burning courts, iron cities, endless dungeons, and forges of punishment. He is law made cruelty, justice twisted into domination. It was Azhadûn who first carved order from the chaos of the lower void, branding each layer of Hell with his name and decree. No soul is damned by accident — all who fall under his domain have agreed to something, even if they didn’t know the price.
He does not rage. He does not lie. He writes. He binds. He judges. His dominion is absolute — not through strength, but through structure. He is the ultimate contract, the last loophole, the unbreakable clause.
Dogma
 All power is earned through service, and all service is bound in oath. Choice is an illusion until it is signed in blood. Mercy is weakness. Freedom is chaos. Bind what you conquer. Rule what you bind. Let none escape their obligations — not even yourself.

 Azhadûn appears as a towering figure in segmented black-gold armor, draped in crimson judicial robes trimmed with glowing infernal script. His face is concealed behind a sculpted mask of law and fire, never removed. In one hand, he carries Inquisitus, the Rod of Eternal Accord — a staff that brands truths into reality. His voice is absolute: when he speaks, all else falls silent.
Fellowship
 The worship of Azhadûn is strict, ritualized, and ancient. Devils are his enforcers, judges, jailers, scribes, and conquerors. Mortal cults to Azhadûn often form within authoritarian regimes, tyrannical orders, or among ambitious mages seeking eternal contracts.
The Chainforged: Devils of the lower circles who serve as enforcers of infernal law. Their chains are sentient, wrapping around liars and oathbreakers without command.
Accorded Eyes: Infernal scribes, both mortal and fiendish, who draft contracts, wills, and magical bindings. Their quills are dipped in soul-ink, and their work is said to last even beyond death.
The Order of the Final Clause: Judges and arch-devils who believe every soul will eventually serve Azhadûn — willingly or not. They offer terms of salvation, knowing that damnation lies in the fine print.
Ulvaarak, the Howling Maw – Greater God of Madness, Ruin, and Endless Hunger
Symbol: A gaping mouth surrounded by writhing claws and torn banners
Granted Powers: Demons gain immunity to psychic and necrotic damage. Once per long rest, they may explode into a violent swarm of teeth, wings, or shadow upon taking lethal damage, reforming within 1d6 rounds elsewhere in the Abyss.
Allowed Alignments: Chaotic Evil only
Ulvaarak is chaos incarnate — the yawning madness at the core of the Abyssal Plane. He did not create the Abyss — he is the Abyss. Born of the screaming remnants of forgotten gods devoured in the first divine wars, Ulvaarak exists as an ever-shifting mass of insanity, hunger, and blasphemy. He is every scream never answered, every wound never healed, every madness never named.
He does not rule the Abyss. He is its will — fractured, howling, and eternal. Each demon lord is merely a shard of his broken psyche, clawing for dominance in a place where meaning has no place. He is feared even by his own creations, and worshipped not with prayer, but with slaughter.
Dogma
 Tear. Ruin. Feed. There is no order, no truth, no purpose but destruction. Creation is a lie. Civilization is a cage. You are the claw through which Ulvaarak gnaws the world. Laugh as you kill. Scream as you die. You are already part of him.

 Ulvaarak has no fixed form. His most common manifestation is a titanic, shifting amalgam of wings, fangs, limbs, and ever-screaming mouths. His presence corrupts air, stone, and sanity alike. When he must speak, his voice speaks through his followers — a thousand mouths screaming at once in different tongues, all agreeing in violence. His weapon is Abyssgrin, a serrated fang the size of a cathedral, which appears only when he wishes a world consumed.
Fellowship
 Ulvaarak's "followers" are cults of madness, demonic broods, and warbands of destruction. His essence bleeds into all chaos, his whispers crawl beneath every massacre, and his name is carved in blood wherever meaning collapses.
Maws of the Thousand: Cults of cannibalistic prophets who believe each act of devouring brings them closer to being “swallowed back” into the Maw.
Gorehowlers: Screaming berserkers and demonic warlords who tear open the veil between planes through sheer violence. They fight not for conquest, but to ruin the very concept of victory.
Children of Shard-Flesh: Demonic savants who sew different pieces of Ulvaarak’s will into flesh, creating warped “prophets” of madness. They do not speak — their bodies pulse with ritual screams encoded in muscle.
