# Geography

At the time of the Prime and initial Campaign title “Godstones”, the ‘known’ world of Malkoros is only a single massive Pangea-like continent named after the world. There are a few islands, and an archipelago known as the “Shattered Isles”. The continent is divided into seven realms:

## Realms of Malkoros

### Isodora
Isodora - The centralized realm - It is the largest melting pot in all of Malkoros with a hybrid geographical layout. The geography consists of mountains, hills, lakes, forests, grasslands, plains, rivers, and more; Therefore, it is the centralized hub of the world, and an allusion to a Modern-day Rome, for all roads across Malkoros lead to Isodora’s capital city, Arman.
### Freyar
Freyar - To the West of Isodora - it consists of mostly grassland, mountains, and hills that eventually transition into beaches and coastlines of the sea.
### Saalrand
Saalrand - To the Southwest of Isodora - it is littered with marshes, bogs, swamps, and Putrid forests. These stretch for miles until individuals come across the black beach coastlines that lead to the sea.
### Caltorra
Caltorra - To the South of Isodora - This land is a dense forest that is mostly populated by elves, gnomes, and the largest ecosystem of creatures, critters, and entities. “The Glades” is the name of the thickest forest section. This realm has a certain quaint charm to it that has mystified scholars for centuries.
### Bellark
Bellark - To the Southeast of Isodora - It is a vast assortment of sand, dunes, and wasteland that is plagued by barbarians, thieves, monsters, and hidden riches. The land looks very “out of place” from a world view, as the surrounding lands do not give any indication as to why the sand might have been formed there.
### Lumella
Lumella - To the East of Isodora - This land is a mixture of mountains, lakes, canyons, and typical grass terrain that has many exports from its various kingdoms. This land is divided into four kingdoms that are constantly trying to keep up and gain an advantage on the others. These kingdoms often wage war against one another. The four kingdoms are:
Repiweth - Northwest kingdom of Lumella
Kukivalon - Southwest kingdom of Lumella
Pekar - Northeast kingdom of Lumella
Mairene - Southeast kingdom of Lumella
### Dramfark
Dramfark - To the North of Isodora - It is a snow-capped mountain and valley region that is home to many flying folk, dwarves, Goliaths, and monstrosities if you were to venture too deep.

In addition to the seven realms of Malkoros, there is the Underdark. In the current “Godstones” Campaign timeline, there are three established cities in the Underdark, but they are not all “known” to the inhabitants of Malkoros. They are as follows:

## Underdark 

### Umbark
Umbark - This is a city in the underdark which has many entrances; however, Umbark can be most easily reached through the Mountain Mines of Meltorra in Dramfark. This is the friendliest of the underdark territories ran by Drow and Deep Gnomes alike. They work in unison to inform surface dwellers of the dangers and beauties that the underdark offers.
### Umethrynn
Umethrynn - This city’s entrance is hidden by the Kingdom of Pekar, a Human kingdom in Lumella. They keep this secret as to utilize its route for otherwise rare minerals to trade, though the other kingdoms have a hunch of its existence. This underdark city is mercantile in nature, as they exchange goods with the Kingdom of Pekar for luxuries of the surface world; however, they do not know that Pekar plans to sweep in soon with a blitz attack to seize the city’s assets and population for its own profit.
### Raenbarad
Raenbarad - A hidden quicksand patch known as the “Bewildering Sands” in the realm of Bellark has been known to swallow unwary travelers. None have returned to tell the tale, but they were actually sucked into the Underdark city of Raenbarad, where they either succumb to their wounds or are enslaved by Drow. Scholars do not know this and assume they suffocated in the sand. This area of the underdark is very hostile.
