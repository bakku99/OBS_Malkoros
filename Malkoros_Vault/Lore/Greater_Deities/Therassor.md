# Therassor

Therassor, Warden of Justice â€“ God of Righteous Battle

As the god of just battle, Therassor is popular among knights, and many otherwise non-religious soldiers and warriors will invoke his name on the battlefield. Clerics of Therassor often work hand-in-hand with the armies of good-aligned secular governments. As relatively little emphasis is placed on religious services, many of this god's clerics may actually serve as "holy warriors" to their respective crowns. It is not uncommon to see a cleric hold an officer's title, as they are well-versed in the teachings of battlefield tactics as well as personal combat.

## Dogma
With steel drawn, do we enter the field of battle. Our foe, we see before us. The call of Therassor beckons us. And we must answer. Singular of action. Honored of duty. To arms for the Honored General.

## Avatar
He is an able-bodied warrior armored in ancient platemail. On his hip, he wears the Ivory Sword, a shaped piece of light and power. His face is rugged and scarred from many battles. His hazel eyes are sad yet strong.

## Fellowship
The clerics and followers of Therassor depend on their strength and ability in battles more than magics. Any magics they use are for combat, healing, protection, and guarding.
The fellowships of Therassor include the following:

### Warders of the Gate
The Warders are warrior-clerics who defend the line against darkness and evil. Strong of arm and heart, they face the oncoming darkness wrought in the world by man and beast. Their numbers are found among the greatest of cities and nations and the most quiet and peaceful of villages. This is the largest of Therassor's fellowships with many city guards, warriors, ethical mercenaries, and lords turning to his worship.

### Governors of Battle
The Governors are tacticians of battle. These warriors begin as scribes and work their way up through a rigorous knighthood to become members. Their studies not only include warfare but the best routes for supplies, keeping wars from overwhelming the populace, the best use of numbers against various odds, and the political meanderings of treaties. They are a holy order seeking to balance honor and dignity with warfare and safety. Although these warriors adhere to a stringent set of rules, they rarely allow the prestige to go to their head. Governors are found among the human nations.

### Ghardankuldar (Stalwart Warriors)
Born in the dwarven halls of Hughfaruhm and Degh Kuldohr, the warlike dwarves fought amongst themselves and others. As the blood flowed like rivers under the great mountains, the wise warchiefs sought a moral code to follow to end the chaos and strengthen their warriors against outside threats. Coming in a vision was Therassor, guised as the dwarven warrior-king Ghardan Aglar (Stalwart Blade). He battled their greatest of warriors and granted them with his teachings. Their sense of honor awakened, they gathered into an incredible force seeking to bring down the tyranny of poor leaders, end the unethical fighting of mercenaries, and stop the dark tide of Othys's armies. Now many humans have joined the Stalwart Warriors.
