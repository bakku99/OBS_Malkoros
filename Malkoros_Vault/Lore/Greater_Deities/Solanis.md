# Solanis

Solanis, God of Light and Life

Priests of Solanis are welcome in almost any town, and are often considered to be good luck. This god is favorably viewed by commoners, and his worship is widespread.

## Dogma
Solanis is the great light of goodness that shines upon all. He gives light and life, strengthening the good of heart. He admonishes the darkness, burning away evil and unlife with his radiance. So to must we shine upon the world, the holy embodiments of his will and light. Live every day to the fullest, and in doing so, set an example for all people, so that life is never a gift to be taken for granted.

## Avatar
Solanis appears as a great lord of light and life. He stands tall and serene, yet a great sense of strength and purpose is felt in his form. His age is undeterminable, though older than youth and younger than elder. His eyes blaze golden as the sun, his hair a corona of light. He wears blazing robes of yellow with few adornments.

## Fellowship
The clerics and followers of Solanis tend to use magics of enlightenment, knowledge, healing, and protection. Their work is benevolent, bringing light and hope to people while casting back the darkness. They excel at working against the undead.
The fellowships of Solanis include the following:

### Eyes of the Blazing Sun
The Eyes seek out darkness in the world, be it of the heart or of the undead. They bring forth the words and will of Solanis to aid the world. These followers travel the world widely, erecting and maintaining churches and temples in many towns and cities. They are wise sages who balance charitable works, preaching, and warring against evil. This is the largest of Solanis' fellowships, with large temples in Isodora, Dramfark, Freya, and Lumella.

### Society of Luminaries
The Society seeks to understand the darkness and light in the world. These loremasters maintain incredible libraries of knowledge regarding the cosmos, the struggles of man against demons, and the enlightenment of angels. The Society includes a wide range of tradesmen and artisans such as bookbinders, painters, and singers. Some remain in seclusion in the churches of the Eyes, documenting their words and copying the words of Solanis for others. Other members travel the world singing of the tales of Solanis and the writers. If ever a warrior needed to understand how to defeat darkness, it is said this Society either knows or can get the information. This fellowship binds the various sects of Solanis.

### Dawnbringers
Secretive and wary, the Dawnbringers infiltrate warrens of darkness to destroy and banish evil from the world. As their name states, they bring the light of Solanis into the heart of eternal night to bear it away. Their numbers are never truly known, though some of the greatest battles and cataclysmic events have been noted as the final acts of the Dawnbringers. Some of Solanis' brethren consider the sect as insane and foolish while others pray for their safety and good works.

### Knights of Aina'rutha
These knights are powerful clerics who seek to end the tyranny and evil of the dark and undead. The Aina'rutha, or Holy Anger, was founded by two clerics: Gilmandrion, priest of Solanis, and Amiolia, priestess of Solanis. The two met in Vanulum to answer the aid of the council under attack by dark forces. Together, they worked to banish the darkness and heal the injured. After the terror passed, the two spoke with others and soon a following was formed. Members typically are elven and human, though some dwarves have come to the call.
