# Othys

Othys - God of Death

Nickname: The Devourer, The Walker of Shadows

Othys is said to be the keeper of the underworld and ruler of hells, though that is not true. Though many think of him as an evil entity, others recognize that death is part of the circle of life and should be embraced, not condemned. While there are temples throughout Malkoros dedicated to Othys, worshippers might be frowned upon or thought of as eccentric and avoidable characters.

## Dogma
The Walker of Shadows takes all from life to the lands of shade and rest, for his lands are of the dead. Death is the night as life is the day; one cannot exist without the other. Some seek a bloody end, others peaceful and quiet. But all come before the Devourer eventually.

## Avatar
Othys appears as a young man of charcoal skin and pale white eyes. Long tendrils of black hair float around him as he waits patiently for the end. He wears a mix of armor and robes the colors of midnight trimmed in a deep green. Upon his breast lies the Vial of Night, holding the twisted and turned tears of Solanis. Only the Walker of Shadows knows what they will do, though many wonder and question.

## Fellowship
The clerics and followers of Othys employ necromatic magics mixed with guardian to bring the living and themselves closer to the dead and undead.
The paths of Othys include the following:

### Attendants of the Rapture
The Attendents are the largest group of Othys's paths. This path teaches the loving touch of death as the end of one life for another. These are the keepers of Othys's realm, the land of shade and rest. Their words are comforting, inviting the end through an acceptance of Othys's sweet and kind embrace, to take the Walker of Shadows as a lover and lord. The churches of the Attendents include many symbols of peace and tranquility, of acceptance and ascension. The Attendants believe to join with Othys is to achieve ultimate peace and balance. The path also keeps and performs the funeral rites for the dead or dying. Some of the followers of other dieties have sought the Attendants to aid them in the passing of their own. This path may be found throughout the lands of man and elf, with a scant few in the lands of dwarf and gnome.

### Dark Hand
Members of the Dark Hand take a dark road of death, delivering its chill touch to those they deem worthy. These are the judges, the dividers of the way. Their methods are questionable and bent, gaining the fear and loathing of most of the pantheon and people of Malkoros. Their techniques include torture, deprevation, and bloodletting. And those that receive their dark gift are those who meet the sometimes twisted, other times coldly calculating, sense of worth. The numbers of this path grow and dwindle without any clear reason. They are found typically around the human nations, the various mines of Dramfark, and the Underdark nations.

### Dragons of Smoke
The path of Dragons bespeaks of anger and vengeance. This is the dark and dangerous face of Othys. The Dragons are assassins without compare, seeking to deliver the taste and pain of death with a swift stroke. They believe they fulfill Othys's anger and pain against those who deserve death as their only punishment. The souls taken by these killers are tied to their killer by Othys's will. The assassins then teach the soul through whisperings and deeds of why they have been killed and the blessing of their return as followers of the Devourer, for they have been chosen to be his brood. Few know of these followers, these hand-picked and trained assassins. Their numbers are few but powerful. Elves, Dwarves, Tieflings, and Men who have fallen from the light and have stony-hearts are typically chosen by Othys for this path. Never again will they serve another.
