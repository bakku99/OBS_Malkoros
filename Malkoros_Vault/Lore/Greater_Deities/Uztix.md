# Uztix

Uztix - Goddess of Murder and Evil

Uztix ranks cheif among the evil deities of Malkoros. Whether out of loyalty or fear, all of the other dark powers bow to her authority. Worship of Uztix is both widespread and open in the Underdark; elsewhere, it is less common, and much more secretive.
The Dark Lady works through force and conquest wherever possible, but her true forte is in deceit and manipulation. She constantly looks to further her power by corrupting those who can be compromised.

## Dogma
Ours is the path of power and rulership. Our dominion is the world. The keys of power are within our reach. Now is the time to take them! Any who wish to stand before us will fall. We will clease the world in our vision and rise from its ashes victorious.

## Avatar
Uztix appears as a strikingly beautiful seductress with raven black hair and sapphire violet eyes. She is alluring and tempting, but hidden in the depths of her eyes is the maddening need to destroy and corrupt all in her path. Her appearance sometimes also reveals her true form of a serpent as she has the lower body of a naga, as well as snakelike eyes.

## Fellowship
Clerics and followers of Uztix tend to follow dark and terrible paths of power. They seek to control all people, all lands. And if they must destroy them first only to rebuild, they will. These corruptors learn dark arts of destruction as well as rites and rituals of knowledge.
The fellowships of Uztix include the following:

### Riders of the Dark Tide
The Riders are a terrible force of darkness and terror. They gather the minions of the dead and demonic to their banner to war against the warriors of light. Many in this legion become unholy powers, including vampires, shades, and death lords. They are known for their undead mounts with eyes of purple flame. Only the most powerful and unbalanced of her legions enter this path, for it chains their souls to the Dark Enchantress.

### Oracles of Oblivion
The Oracles watch the cosmos and the hearts of people for a chance to corrupt. With darkened visions and magics, they delve deeply into the world to find its hidden truths to taint and twist for their own means. And once they have delivered their seed, they lie in wait and help it grow. Many of Uztix's followers take to this path.

### Walkers of the Serpentine Labyrinth
The Walkers build and rebuild the world and mythos around them in an attempt to lose all peoples in their webs. The minds and machinations of these followers are considered mad, but only because Uztix herself is the only true seer of their logic. Uztix began this sect to hide her plots and desires from the rest of the world. Over the ages, the small sect has gained other followers. Some in Uztix's church believe that the web connects all of her followers through their dark dreams and desires, but only the Walkers know the truth. New Walkers are rare indeed for this web, as they are selected only by Uztix herself.
