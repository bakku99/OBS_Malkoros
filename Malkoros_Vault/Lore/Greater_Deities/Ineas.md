# Ineas

Ineas - Goddess of Knowledge

Followers of Ineas, like their dietress, seek knowledge. Priests of Ineas are often sough as advisors and seers.

## Dogma
We stand in the mists of time and thought. They bring to us whispers of what the world is, of its secrets, of its mysteries. Within the gray, we seek to know. Knowledge is like the mist, ephemeral and shapeless. We must gather it to us and record it for those will come after, those who tred in our footsteps, those who bring their neverending questions.

## Avatar
Ineas appears as a wizened woman with flowing hair of silver white. Her skin is like parchment, weathered and ancient. Yet, she stands tall and straight as a younger woman. Most remarkable about her are her glittering eyes of brown and nimble hands. She cloaks herself in robes of gray surrounding with hovering motes of brillient power. She walks with a staff of white wood. Around its top are a ring of small silver stars that float in varying patterns, a gift from Atotz, her wife. She always carries great tomes with her if she wanders from her library.

## Fellowship
The followers and clerics of Ineas tend to use magics to unearth secrets, such as spells of divination, knowledge, and charm. They typically use their spells only in this pursuit, gaining the disdain of others who would rather they use their divinity for people.
The paths of Ineas include the following:

### Path of Dynasty
This path seeks the enlightenment and power of knowledge, secrets, and lore. Walkers of this path, or Lords, seek to know everything and anything. They are brokers of secrets of people, places, and things. Their knowledge and curiousity is vast as their libraries and memories. Many a king or noble lord has been aided and defeated by the Lords. The Lords rarely talk amongst each other, for fear of losing secrets to another; however, they do gather every few years in Arman to speak of what they have learned, sometimes to check for pieces they may not have.

### Path of Adepts
This path seeks the ever changing power and mysteries of magic. Walkers of this path, or Magisters, are the divine counterparts to mages. The Magisters are adepts of herbs, alchemy, elements, rotes, rituals, and ancient lores yet found to create and expand the limits mages place on magic. When a Magister and a mage meet, the results can be catastrophic and illuminating for both. The Path of Adepts has strong roots in Dalpool, Pekar.

### Path of Beasts
This path seeks to understand and become one with the bestial past of man and the creatures of the world. Walkers of this path, or the Savages, turn their backs on humanity and follow the instincts of survival and beasts. From the mundane to the exotic, these followers want to rejoin nature. However, due to their knowledge and lack of connection, they tend to lose their way, twisting man and creature into strange magical mixes. Some believe the Savages are responsible for the creation of aberrations, lycanthropy, and magical creatures that plague the countryside. The Savages have a loose organization, with strong roots to the Abysnis, Saalrand.

### Path of Ash
This path seeks to understand the power and terror of the dead, undead, the afterlife, demons, and devils. Few walkers of the path, or the Burdens, ever successfully gain great knowledge of this path before dying terrible deaths. However, their knowledge is the greatest when one needs to understand the path of evil. Many nobles of Lumellan kingdoms have sought the Burdens when warring with each other. These followers hide themselves in the Ruins of Thrinacia of Caltorra.
