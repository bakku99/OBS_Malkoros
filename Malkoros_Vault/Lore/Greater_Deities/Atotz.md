# Atotz

Atotz, Lady Luck â€“ Goddess of Luck

Atotz is, quite simply put, Lady Luck. Her devoters are bold, brave, and somewhat reckless. Luck is the only thing that they rely on, even though it sometimes fails them.

## Dogma
Chance and luck are the virtues of the spritely of heart, keen of eye, and merry of soul. The way of melancholy and fear are not within our power. To tip the scales, to surmount the impossible, to taste heaven, to escape with riches from hell...these are the realms of delight and danger we seek like a thirsty man for water in Bellark's dunes.

## Avatar
Atotz is one of the deitries who most enjoys visiting the world in mortal form, and appears as an elven or human lady with fiery hair and glittering green eyes. Her eyes seem to giggle and laugh while her face seems reflective when met by adventurers. Her dress differs constantly, depending on her moods, from layers of skirts and finery to practical travelling leathers. She tends to always wear a scarf and pair of gloves in scarlet. On her left hand, she wears the Ring of Zimbus, an artifact of the great bard Zimbus whose songs still fill the small gems of the ring.

## Fellowship
The clerics and followers of Atotz tend to use magics to help them accomplish impossible tasks. Their uses of charm, divination, and blessings are among the best. They meld their use of magic with diverse abilities to help them change the fortunes of the world.
The fellowships of Atotz are much more loosely organized than those of many other religions, and include the following:

### Spinning Stars
These followers seek to become bright and shining stars of Atotz. The largest group of worshippers, the Stars walk the world seeking to understand the loving and fickle nature that is fortune and chance. Their views are the basis of Atotz's teachings. One of the largest of Atotz's churches run by the Stars is a gambling house and temple in Taavine, Lumella.

### Laughing Maidens
This all-female group travels the world teaching newcomers to the open road what it trully means to be an adventurer. Many of these women began as serving wenches and daughters of great warriors that did not understand why only men could adventure. Each of them left the safety of their homes and found a common following of other women who loved the freedom of the road. Members of this group meet in taverns throughout Malkoros, with the largest congregation forming in The Glades.

### Lovers of Fortune
Many people believe the Lovers are one of the most frightening and stupid groups of people on the face of Malkoros. These followers of Atotz literally throw themselves into dangerous situations, be it leaping from tall cliffs, mooing like a cow to a minotaur, or running into a dragon's maw. It is through their acceptance of chance and the luck of their goddess that they survive. Though, the course of the Lovers' history includes many who have fallen in the service of the Scarlet Mistress.
