# Hostus

Hostus- God of Nature

Hostus is the patron god of the Elves, as well as the lord of nature in Malkoros. His followers are powerful in nature, focusing themselves on the healing and control of nature rather than combat. He is the father of seasons, the center of the world, the wisdom of trees and stone. Hostus is worshipped abundantly in Caltorra but renown all over Malkoros.

## Dogma
Nature is the way of survival, of beauty, of ugliness. Through becoming one with nature, we shall understand the world. Through understanding the world, we shall grow strong and wise as the ancient oaks. To be one with nature is to be one with growth and destruction: for each peaceful act, their is an opposite of angry retribution.

## Avatar
Hostus appears as a young elven man, strong of body. He stands tall and thick as the ancient trees of his forests. His hair shimmers in flaxen colors of sunlight. His eyes mirror the depths of lakes. Hostus wears mismatched leathers and bits and pieces from his forests, such as leaves and feathers. He carries with him the Staff of Forests, a root with a golden leaf carved within it.

## Fellowship
The clerics and followers of Hostus tend toward magics that aid them in working with and controlling animals, plants, and the elements.
The Fellowships of Hostus include the following:

### Eyes of Creation
The Eyes watch and protect all of nature. They can be found within all environments from urban cities to desolate plains. They see beauty and pain in all settings of nature. Through their patient work, they seek to aid life in those areas, to help it survive and thrive against the dangers of encroaching man or the changes of time.

### Dancers of the Oak
The Dancers take great joy in nature, the power and beauty of it. These followers tend to be beautiful in some way, be it of features or art. They seek to touch all of nature, to enhance its beauty and life, to heal and nuture. Each season of spring, they gather around oak trees, dancing in the moonlight and weaving ribbons of greens, golds, and pinks. If the year proves to be favorable, the ribbons blossom into flowers and vines the next morning.

### Witchlings of the Night
The Witchlings are a group that the followers of Hostus wish they could forget. When Hostus tasted Othys's tongue and blood, a dark seed of anger and treachery blossomed in the lord of nature. When he spat forth that tongue and seed into the earth, fires erupted and birthed a child of dark nature. This child gathered followers of Othys, who believe nature is dangerous, beautiful, and deadly. To this day, this small and secretive sect works to destroy all creations of civilization, and then replace them with their ideal of nature.
