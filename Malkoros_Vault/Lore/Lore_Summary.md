# Lore Summary

Malkoros is a custom campaign setting built for **Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition**.
It blends classic high-fantasy and dark-fantasy themes with a focus on divine influence and the deeds of heroes who shape the fate of the world. While unofficially part of the D&D multiverse, Malkoros has its own pantheon structure with unique Gods/Deities. Additionally, it has its own fully fleshed out calendar with detailed mechanics including the calculation of its two moons and their phases. These moons, Lyccara and Nerunel, are deeply rooted within the lore of Malkoros - marking a fundamental derivation from how traditional D&D settings handle Lycanthropy. 

In the world of **Malkoros**, a vast Pangaea-like continent sprawls beneath the gaze of **two moons**—the silvery **Lyccara** and the ominous crimson **Nerunel**—whose cycles influence not just the tides and time, but magic, fate, and the transformation of lycanthropes. The land is divided into **seven great realms**—Isodora, Freyar, Dramfark, Bellark, Saalrand, Caltorra, and Lumella—each with its own unique cultures, deities, and political tensions. Ancient godwars and divine betrayals shattered the old order, giving rise to mortal empires and fractured pantheons, many of which still contend with the legacies of their creators. Arcane phenomena like the **Maw of Night**—a rare celestial alignment of both moons—serve as omens of upheaval and transformation, stirring divine and infernal powers alike.
