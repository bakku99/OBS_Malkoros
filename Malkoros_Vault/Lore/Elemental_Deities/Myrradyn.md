# Myrradyn

Myrradyn, the Shattered Loom – Greater God of Arcane, Knowledge, and Unraveling

Myrradyn is the source of the raw Weave — the ever-unraveling tapestry from which all arcane power is drawn. He is the architect and anomaly of the Elemental Plane of Arcane, a surreal and boundless expanse of floating glyphs, drifting libraries, sentient spells, and wild magic storms. Myrradyn was not created — he was discovered. Or perhaps summoned, or fractured into being when thought and energy first collided. No record agrees.
He is magic in its truest, wildest form: brilliant, unstable, self-aware, and never quite the same shape twice. To follow Myrradyn is to chase understanding while knowing it will always elude you — and to accept that the journey itself is where the power lies.

## Dogma
 Magic is not control. It is communion. Knowledge is not safety — it is temptation, and the boundary between mastery and madness is a veil made of ink and fire. Seek, learn, lose, relearn. Let your mind fracture into a prism, and you will see what cannot be seen whole. Let go. Cast wide. Unravel.

## Avatar
 Myrradyn appears differently to every being who sees him — as a child made of floating runes, a many-eyed scholar with parchment skin, or a living constellation with a broken loom at his back. One constant remains: his voice always overlaps itself in seven languages at once, and his shadow behaves as if cast by a light source that doesn’t exist. He wields Inlassarith, the Needle Beyond Ends — a living quill-needle that can stitch or cut spells, fate, and reality.

## Fellowship
 His followers are arcanists, wild mages, seekers of forbidden lore, and beings who embody the chaos of magic itself. To them, madness is merely the cost of touching truth. Spell elementals, living glyphs, and ancient constructs walk his halls.

### The Loomwalkers
Planar travelers and spell-weavers who study how magic ties all things together. They believe every spell cast is a ripple across the true Weave, and they seek to learn its original language.

### Inkborn Choir
Transmuted spell-scrolls given sentience, along with mortal archivists who believe writing is the purest form of worship. Their prayers are written, never spoken, and sometimes change retroactively.

### Fractaline Circle
A secretive cabal of mages who willingly break their own minds to glimpse higher arcane understanding. They function as collective beings — fractured but unified — wielding unstable magic with unmatched creativity.
