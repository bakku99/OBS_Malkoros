# Pyrius

Pyrius, the Eternal Flame – Greater God of Fire, Passion, and Destruction

Pyrius is the creator and sovereign of the Plane of Fire, the eternal inferno from which flame itself was born. His arrival is remembered only in primal echoes: the ignition of the first sun, the cracking open of volcanic hearts, the kindling of cosmic passion. Pyrius embodies both the unrelenting chaos of wildfire and the nurturing warmth of the hearth. He is worshipped by fire elementals, salamanders, azers, efreeti, and mortal flamebound cults scattered across the planes.
Pyrius is neither cruel nor kind — he simply burns. Where his touch passes, new things are forged in place of the old. His power is not just destruction, but the crucible through which transformation becomes possible.

## Dogma
 Flame consumes, but it also purifies. All things are tested in fire — those that endure are worthy. Let your passion burn away hesitation. Embrace destruction not for cruelty, but for renewal. The world is not static; it must be tempered and reforged endlessly in the fire of change.

## Avatar
 Pyrius appears as a colossal humanoid form composed of molten obsidian and living fire. His movements echo like breaking magma plates. He wears no armor, for flame is his defense and wrath his offense. His crown is a wreath of eternal fire that burns in perfect silence. When he speaks, entire volcanoes are said to erupt in harmony.

## Fellowship
 The worship of Pyrius spans the Elemental Plane of Fire and beyond. His followers are elementals, fire spirits, warlords of ash, and visionary crafters who see fire as the sacred tool of divine renewal.

### Burning Sons
Devoted warriors and monks who burn away impurity through sacred flame. They practice immolation rituals and view pain as the passage to transcendence. Often seen leading purging missions against planar invaders or corruption.

### Cinderscribes
Chroniclers of transformation who use flame to create impermanent masterpieces, from architecture to living beings. They believe true art can only be born in flame — and must also die in it.

### The Ashen Conclave
A secretive order of efreeti and salamanders who see Pyrius not only as a god of creation, but as the rightful ruler of all elemental planes. They plan conquest in his name, though Pyrius himself seems indifferent to mortal politics.
