# Zephrayl

Zephrayl, the Roaring Gale – Greater God of Wind, Sky, and Freedom

Zephrayl is the endless sky, the shifting breeze, and the deafening storm. He is the creator and soul of the Elemental Plane of Wind — a realm of floating isles, howling vortexes, cloud citadels, and vast, unreachable heights. Where other elemental lords impose order or permanence, Zephrayl is motion incarnate. His breath stirs the elemental planes, his laughter shatters mountains, and his silence heralds the eye of the storm.
He is a god of travel, revelation, madness, and sudden change — the divine embodiment of unpredictability and freedom. Zephrayl’s winds scatter seeds, carry dreams, and peel the roofs from temples alike. He values no kingdom, but blesses the wanderer, the seeker, and the rebel.

## Dogma
 No chain may hold the sky. Change is truth. Freedom is sacred — never caged, never stilled. Let your voice carry like the wind and your will fly farther still. Do not fear being lost, for the wind knows every path. All things move. Move with them.

## Avatar
 Zephrayl appears as a luminous, ever-shifting figure of cloudstuff and flickering lightning. Sometimes male, sometimes female, sometimes neither, their form is constantly reshaping like a thunderhead on the horizon. Their eyes glow with the light of distant stars, and their laughter can stir a breeze across planes. They carry Sirostral, the Flute of Storms — a relic said to summon a gale strong enough to tear apart fate itself.

## Fellowship
 Zephrayl’s followers are wanderers, storm-callers, and messengers who thrive in uncertainty. Among djinn, air elementals, cloud giants, and wind-based spirits, he is seen as a source of divine madness and divine freedom alike.

### Cloudchasers
Skyborn acolytes who leap between isles of wind with wings or spells. They believe the soul must fly untethered through both life and afterlife, and they map the “skylines” of all planes.

### Storm Heralds
Oracles and battle-priests who summon tempests in Zephrayl’s name. They bring change to stagnant lands, justice to tyrants, or madness to the overly ordered.

### The Whisperwing
A secretive fellowship of spies, dreamwalkers, and elemental windshapers who pass unseen across borders, listening for divine truths carried on the breeze. They rarely speak — but their messages echo for miles.
