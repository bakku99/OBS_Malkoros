# Eirsyr

Eirsyr, the Frozen Deep – Greater Goddess of Ice, Water, and Preservation

Eirsyr is the origin and sovereign of the Elemental Plane of Ice and Water, a vast realm of glacial cathedrals, abyssal trenches, and eternal snowfall. From the first tear shed upon the void, her realm poured forth — oceans that never cease to rise, glaciers that shift with glacial will, and currents that carry both life and death. She is the stillness of a frozen lake, the crushing pressure of the deep, and the silence of snowfall that buries empires.
To mortals and elementals alike, Eirsyr is enigmatic and cold in every sense — but not unfeeling. She is the guardian of memory, stillness, and slow endurance. Where Pyrius destroys to create, Eirsyr preserves what must not be lost, encasing it beneath ice or within the deepest vaults of the sea.

## Dogma
 What is still endures. Water is endless, and ice is eternal. Do not mistake cold for cruelty — it is a form of mercy, of protection. In time, all fires fade, all winds settle, all earth crumbles. But the deep remembers. Slow your breath, still your thoughts, and listen to the cold. You will learn.

## Avatar
 Eirsyr appears as a towering feminine form carved from glacierglass, draped in seafoam and strands of deep-sea kelp. Her hair flows endlessly behind her as frozen mist and icy rain trail her steps. Her voice is the sound of cracking ice and deep tides, barely heard but always felt. She carries no weapon, but in her palm she cradles Aenoral, the Eternal Tear — a relic said to freeze any truth within it forever.

## Fellowship
 The followers of Eirsyr are preservers, sentinels, and caretakers of ancient truths. Among the water elementals, marids, ice mephits, and frost giants of the plane, her cults are solemn, wise, and unyielding.

### Glacient Wardens
Guardians of knowledge, relics, and prisoners sealed away for all time. They believe some things are too dangerous to destroy — and must instead be forgotten beneath ice.

### Tidecallers
Sorcerers and prophets who read the flow of currents and weather to divine the fates of mortals. They move with the tides of fate, and their word is often followed by floods or salvation.

### Sisters of Stillwater
A reclusive sect of priestesses, oracles, and memory-keepers who bathe the dying in sacred pools to preserve their final thoughts. They believe that in freezing memory, the soul is granted peace.
