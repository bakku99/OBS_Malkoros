# Thavax

Thavax, the World-Root – Greater God of Earth, Endurance, and Secrets

Thavax is the foundation beneath all worlds — the eternal bedrock upon which empires rise and fall. He is the maker and master of the Elemental Plane of Earth, a place of titanic caverns, mountain ranges that pierce the sky, and crystal veins that pulse with primordial memory. His presence is not one of sudden power but of infinite pressure, quiet tectonic force, and impenetrable resolve. He shapes slowly, but permanently.
Though rarely worshipped by mortals, Thavax is revered by stone giants, earth elementals, xorn, galeb duhr, and deep-dwelling civilizations. His voice is the grinding of mountains, his patience eternal. He is often mistaken as uncaring — but in truth, he listens longer than others are willing to speak.

## Dogma
 Stand firm. Let the winds howl and the waters rise — you are stone. Endure, and the world will shift around you. Speak only what you mean, for your word shapes futures. Hidden truths lie buried deep, and only those who dig with purpose may find them. Do not rush. The greatest strength lies in waiting.

## Avatar
 Thavax appears as a colossus of jagged stone, soil, and luminous ore. Moss grows across his shoulders, and veins of crystal pulse in his chest. His face is that of a mountain — unmoving, carved by time. When he walks, the earth quakes. He bears Rendure, a hammer forged from the molten core of the plane itself, capable of reshaping land and truth alike.

## Fellowship
 Thavax’s followers are builders, guardians, and archivists. They shape cities from stone, delve into the deepest mysteries of the world, and serve as unbreakable sentinels in times of upheaval.

### The Deepbound
Architects and geomancers who shape not just stone, but the memory of the land itself. They build temples, vaults, and tombs meant to last for millennia.

### Stonewatchers
Vigilant sentries who never leave their post unless the world demands it. Their oaths are eternal, their discipline unmatched. Many stand guard over ancient seals, buried vaults, or sacred gates.

### Verdant Core
A secretive order of druids and earthspeakers who believe that Thavax slumbers at the heart of the world, and that the deeper one goes, the closer they come to understanding all things. Their roots lie in Caltorra’s deepest groves and caverns.
