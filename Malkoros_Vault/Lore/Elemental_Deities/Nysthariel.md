# Nysthariel

Nysthariel, the Veiled Wound – Greater Goddess of Shadow, Loss, and Hidden Truths

Nysthariel is the breath between the stars, the absence behind every light, and the secret that stares back when the mirror forgets your face. She created the Elemental Plane of Shadow from the first pain of the world — a wound left in reality when the light and dark first split. Her domain is a place of dim twilight, echoing voids, and reflections that lie. The plane pulses with old memories, fractured moments, and hidden paths not taken.
To her followers, Nysthariel is not a goddess of evil, but of knowing what others are afraid to see. She embraces what is lost, what is hidden, and what cannot be undone. She is mystery, regret, and revelation — and she loves without warmth.

## Dogma
 Light blinds. Shadow reveals. That which is hidden is not always evil, and that which is seen is not always true. Embrace the unseen parts of yourself, for only then can you understand others. Loss is not to be feared — it is the proof that something once mattered. We do not forget in shadow. We remember too well.

## Avatar
 Nysthariel appears as a tall, slender figure draped in flowing shrouds of voidsilk. Her face is concealed behind a silver mask that shifts between expressions when unseen. Beneath her veil, no eyes glow — only absence. Her voice echoes softly like remembered whispers. In her hands she carries Throsyl, the Blade Unspoken — a curved dagger that never reflects light and can cut through memory.

## Fellowship
 Her followers are spies, mourners, truthseekers, and keepers of things lost. Shadow elementals, umbral spirits, and forgotten shades worship her not in words, but in silence. Her fellowships act as living echoes of pain, purpose, and revelation.

### Maskbearers
Monks and whisperers who wear emotionless masks as symbols of truth withheld. They record every lie they hear and offer those records to Nysthariel in ink made from their own blood.

### The Hollow Remain
Mourners who walk the lands collecting grief. They absorb and preserve the last memories of the dead, sealing them in shadowglass. Their presence is said to ease restless spirits and silence the undead.

### Echobinders
Sorcerers, assassins, and voidmages who bind sound, reflection, and memory to their will. They believe that all stories are shadows cast by greater truths — and that cutting the shadow can reshape the source.
