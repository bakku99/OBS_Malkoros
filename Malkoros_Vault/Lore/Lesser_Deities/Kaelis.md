# Kaelis

Kaelis, the Wildsong – God of Freedom, Chaos, and Revelry

Kaelis was once a mortal druid-chieftain of the flame-hearted Vaerri clans during the final throes of the Age of Iron Chains, a time when the dwarves of Skaldorok and the dragon-kin of Nurakk’s Brood sought to divide the mortal realms between law and tyranny. Around 11,300 BAR, Kaelis united the free tribes not through conquest, but by revels, defiance, and wildfire. Their followers danced barefoot into battle, sang on the gallows, and kindled forest fires that consumed war machines. The night Kaelis was struck down — laughing, drunk, and bloodied atop a burning effigy of a Nurakki warlord — the heavens split with song. A thousand stars fell, and from their midst rose Kaelis, divine and wild-eyed, crowned in flame and antler.

## Dogma
Live freely, burn brightly, and never bow your head. Dance even when your bones ache. Sing when you are silenced. Laughter is a weapon. Freedom is a birthright. Chaos is not destruction — it is the wildfire that clears the rot. Those who would tame you fear the howl of your soul.

## Avatar
Kaelis appears as a androgynous, barefoot figure clothed in leaves, chains, and scarves, all of which whip in unseen wind. Their skin glows with ember tones, their eyes flicker like bonfires, and great antlers sprout from tangled hair woven with feathers and bones. Their weapon, Irjhaar, is a curved blade shaped like a crescent moon, said to sing when swung. Their laugh is said to free the imprisoned and enrage tyrants.

## Fellowship
The faithful of Kaelis range from wandering minstrels to rebel warbands. They are free spirits, saboteurs, prophets, and lovers of life’s messiest moments. Many are hunted in civilized lands, though their music and stories spread faster than fire.

### Emberwilds
Nomadic celebrants who bring songs, wine, and riot to every village they pass. They defy curfews, crash ceremonies, and leave behind festivals that last days. Some call them blessings. Others call them plagues.

### The Chainbreakers
Defiant warriors who liberate slaves, topple despots, and tear down systems of control. Their strikes are unpredictable, their tactics chaotic, but their results undeniable. A Chainbreaker leaves no crown uncracked.

### Stagblood Pact
A savage fellowship of berserkers and beastkin who embrace the primal essence of Kaelis. They dance under moonlight, howl in battle, and believe the wilderness itself is sacred and ungovernable.
