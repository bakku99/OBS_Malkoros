# Seramara

Seramara, the Heartpierced – Goddess of Love, Grief, and Memory

In the twilight years of the Serathan Court, an ancient elven kingdom lost to time and sand, Seramara was once a high-priestess of Solanis and the consort of King Elendir Virelorn. Their love was legendary, and her words could bring peace to entire war camps. But when the king fell in the Battle of Cinderglen around 10,400 BAR, Seramara wandered into the Withering Wastes to weep. There, she was pierced by an arrow of pure sorrow loosed by an unknown divine hand — and in that moment, she took on the suffering of all who mourn. She ascended at the ruins of Elaruin’s Spire, her tears turning to gemstones that now lie buried beneath the desert. Even in divinity, she is both comforter and mourner — a being who teaches that love is eternal, even when memory fades.

## Dogma
Love is not weakness — it is the strongest force in existence. It endures through pain, time, and loss. To grieve is to honor, to remember is to keep alive. Heal others through empathy, protect love where it blooms, and never mock the broken-hearted, for they have known what others fear to feel.

## Avatar
Seramara appears as a statuesque elven woman draped in flowing robes of white and dusk red. Her long hair flows like a river of rose petals, and her eyes shimmer with infinite sorrow and compassion. In her hand, she carries Elendir’s Memory, a long silver arrow said to have slain a god of cruelty. Her voice is soft, like the first rain after a drought, and her presence stills the trembling heart.

## Fellowship
Followers of Seramara are healers, poets, guardians of the grieving, and celebrants of love in all forms. Some serve as wedding priests and midwives, while others walk battlefields offering peace to the dying or closure to the dead.

### Order of the Crimson Veil
A sacred group of griefwardens who preside over funerals, deliver last rites, and assist those who have lost loved ones. They are revered by the common folk and feared by necromancers.

### Seramara’s Thorn
A vengeful sect of lovers scorned or betrayed. They walk a darker road, believing that love defiled must be avenged. While controversial, they are protected by divine sanction — for even love's pain is sacred.
