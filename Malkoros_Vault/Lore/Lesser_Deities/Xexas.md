# Xexas

Xexas, the Betrayer’s Kiss – God of Poison, Treachery, and Beautiful Lies

Xexas was once the royal consort to Empress Varella of the Sangelline Empire, a political union praised across Malkoros for its supposed peace and progress. Behind veils and perfume, Xexas orchestrated the collapse of the empire through poisoned treaties, double-dealing diplomacy, and subtle mind-alteration. Every noble who trusted him fell to madness, disgrace, or a silken blade. As the empire burned from within, Xexas kissed the empress with lips laced in soul-poison — then ascended in a coil of violet smoke as Uztix herself anointed him her divine emissary of betrayal.

## Dogma
Every truth is a lie not yet spoken. Trust is the leash of the naïve. Power lies in illusion, in poison, in whispered words behind silken veils. Kill not with swords, but with smiles. If your enemies believe they are loved, their hearts are yours to crush.

## Avatar
Xexas appears as a breathtakingly elegant figure clad in silk robes of crimson and lavender. His face is ever-shifting — sometimes male, sometimes female, always perfect. His smile never reaches his eyes. He carries Nythara, a jeweled dagger said to hold the venom of every betrayal ever committed. His voice is a lullaby. His presence is narcotic.

## Fellowship
Xexas’ followers are spies, assassins, courtiers, and seducers. They thrive in high society and low shadows, turning friends against each other with a sigh. Many claim not to serve him — yet still wear his colors and practice his creed.

### Bladed Veil
A deadly cabal of courtesans and actors who double as master assassins. Every performance, every love affair, may be a trap.

### Children of the Second Tongue
Diplomats, scribes, and spies who speak lies as if they were prophecy. Their oath: “We speak, and the world bends.”

### Lachrymists
Poison-makers and torturers who believe suffering is art. Their toxins don’t just kill — they reveal. To be Lachrymisted is to confess your soul.
