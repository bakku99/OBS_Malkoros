# Vaelreth

Vaelreth, the Burning Oath – God of Vengeance and Justice

In the final centuries of the Obrenic Dominion — a cruel empire that stretched across the central plains of what is now Caltorra and Freya — a nameless slave rose to lead the Ashen Rebellion. This man, branded and beaten from birth, became known as Vaelreth after he took up the sword Judicar, said to be gifted by Therassor himself, or perhaps born of Vaelreth’s own fury. With it, he led a brutal uprising against the Obrenic tyrants, culminating in the execution of High King Molzareth the Chainfather in the city of Myr'Toruun around 8700 BAR. The flames that consumed the Obrenic palaces never died in memory. When Vaelreth stood upon the ashes of that golden throne and swore his final oath — that no tyrant would rise again unchallenged — he was struck by divine lightning and ascended before the eyes of thousands.

## Dogma
Let no injustice stand unchallenged. When the law fails the people, become the flame that tempers it. Oaths are sacred — break them, and you invite ruin. If you seek vengeance, do so with purpose, not hatred. Punish the wicked, protect the innocent, and never let fear silence your fire.

## Avatar
Vaelreth appears as a tall, muscular man with dark, scorched skin and eyes of smoldering ember. His left wrist is shackled with a broken chain that drags behind him, clinking with every step. He wears cracked, blackened armor once gilded in gold, now tarnished by fire. His right hand wields Judicar, a massive greatsword wreathed in eternal white flame, known to leave no ash, only justice. His voice rumbles like distant thunder, calm yet heavy with the weight of every oath ever broken.

## Fellowship
Vaelreth's followers often begin as victims or warriors for justice. They are judges, rebels, inquisitors, and guardians. Some walk the halls of power as magistrates or paladins, while others strike from the shadows to end corruption at its roots.

### Scorchbearers
These avengers carry the Flame of Vaelreth into the heart of darkness. They hunt slavers, tyrants, and corrupt nobles, delivering divine judgment without mercy. Their presence is often feared even by the righteous.

### Keepers of the Brand
Once broken souls, the Keepers mark themselves with Vaelreth's sigil as a sign of eternal oath. They protect the weak and uphold the law where law has crumbled. They rarely kill — but their punishments are swift and absolute.

### Ashen Circle
A small, secretive sect of philosophers, ex-judges, and cursed warriors who debate the boundaries of vengeance and justice. They believe that blind retribution leads only to new cycles of tyranny — and that only the wise should wield the flame.
