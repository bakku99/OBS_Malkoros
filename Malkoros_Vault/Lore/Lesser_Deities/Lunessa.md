# Lunessa

Lunessa, the Pale Watcher – Goddess of Moonlight, Secrets, and Cycles

Lunessa is the stillness of the night, the changing face of truth, and the soft silver whisper that stirs in the silence. She governs secrets kept and revealed, the cycles of nature and emotion, and the veiled paths walked by moonlight. Though she is worshipped openly in some circles, many of her most devout never speak her name aloud.

## Dogma
All things change as the moon waxes and wanes. Secrets are not sins, for concealment can be as sacred as confession. What is hidden in shadow may yet be revealed in light — or may remain safely hidden, forever. Trust the tides of time and hold to silence when speech may bring ruin.

## Avatar
Lunessa appears as a tall, willowy elf-like figure, pale as moonlight, cloaked in robes that shimmer between silver and violet. Her eyes are veiled by strands of glowing thread like spider silk, and her voice echoes softly as if from a distant mountain. She carries no weapon, but her mere presence chills deceit and draws confession.

## Fellowship
The faithful of Lunessa walk the thin line between revelation and concealment. Some are secret-keepers, counselors, or spies. Others are guardians of hidden knowledge or pilgrims of prophecy. The moon is their shield and their torch, and many feel a divine connection to its phases.

### Veilbound
Guardians of secrets and hidden truths, these followers protect knowledge that could unravel kingdoms. They serve rulers, spies, and historians alike — but never give their loyalty blindly.

### Moonlit Striders
Wandering protectors of the night, the Striders help travelers find their way by moonlight and stalk creatures that hunt from the shadows. They are silent sentinels, ever watching.

### Echoes of Lunessa
A cryptic sect that believes the moon itself is a sentient entity beyond Lunessa — that she is merely its chosen voice. Their rituals and dreams are filled with whispers from the far beyond.
