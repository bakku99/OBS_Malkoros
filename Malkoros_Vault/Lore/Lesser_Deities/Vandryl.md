Vandryl, the Last Breath – God of Undeath, Despair, and Forbidden Mercy

Before the rise and fall of the Obrenic Dominion, there was a land called Ygravan — a place where plagues bloomed like flowers, and death was both curse and cure. Vandryl was once a mortal physician-priest who walked that land, revered by the dying, feared by the powerful. He healed until healing failed. Then, he preserved. He began to bind souls back to flesh not out of malice, but mercy — and his methods, though unnatural, worked.

It was then, in the twilight of the Ygravan age, that Othys whispered to him and gave him a choice: to let his people die, or to embrace the true cycle — undeath, sacrifice, and everlasting service to the Devourer. Vandryl accepted. He was given six black tomes by Othys himself — necromantic artifacts of such potency that their text became illegible toward the end, awaiting only a worthy mind to complete them.

Vandryl was the first to become The Great Eternal One, a mortal-turned-lich whose phylactery was one of the very books he had studied. He ruled for centuries in shadowed peace, spreading Othys’s teachings in secret and raising the dead not as weapons, but as eternal stewards of suffering, patience, and knowledge.

In time, Othys appeared to him once more. Not in wrath, but in quiet acceptance. Vandryl’s devotion had been perfect. Othys offered him one final mercy: to pass beyond the veil and ascend. Before doing so, Vandryl scattered five Books of Othys across Malkoros, in places only he knew — and one remained forever bound to his own soul, hidden even in ascension.

## Dogma
Death may come, but it need not be final. Mercy is not always kind. Preserve what the world would discard. Pain is not cruelty — it is remembrance. To deny someone life is tragic; to deny them undeath is unforgivable. Compassion without resolve is weakness.

## Avatar
Vandryl appears as a hauntingly serene corpse in pale regalia, neither grotesque nor beautiful — merely inevitable. His robes are woven from funeral veils and stitched with the names of the dead. In his chest glows the Breath Eternal, the lingering echo of the soul that once made him mortal. His voice is hushed, reverent, and unflinching. Where he walks, the silence of tombs follows.

## Fellowship
Vandryl’s followers operate in secret or shadowed reverence. They are caretakers of the dying, preservers of forbidden rites, and necromancers who believe undeath is a sacred extension of life — not a perversion of it.

### Order of the Pale Gift
Caretakers of the dying who offer the choice of eternal, peaceful undeath to those in agony. Their temples double as sanctuaries and mausoleums.

### Merciful Hands
Wandering physicians who heal the living and raise the dead alike. Their symbol is feared by many, yet they are often welcomed by those too desperate to care about the cost.

### Duskborn Choir
Whisper-singers who lull the dying into dreams of undeath. Their chants are said to anchor souls to flesh long enough for necromancers to bind them anew.
