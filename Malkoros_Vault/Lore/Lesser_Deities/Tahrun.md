# Tahrun

Tahrun, the Shattered Eye – God of Dreams, Madness, and Prophecy

Long before the Anatharian Reckoning, during the fracturing of the Kelanith Convergence — a forgotten era when reality itself was said to flicker and bend — there lived a mortal sage named Tahrun in the floating city of Sel’Vaeleth, now lost beneath the Mirrored Sea. Tahrun was a quiet man cursed with visions of futures that had not happened and voices that were not his own. Over time, he surrendered to the dreams, recording them on endless scrolls and sleepwalking across the veil between planes. When the city collapsed in a surge of unstable magic around 12,800 BAR, only Tahrun remained, floating amid its ruin, muttering poetry in the tongue of stars. His mind had shattered — but from those fragments, he ascended. To dream of Tahrun is to risk insight… or madness.

## Dogma
The mind is a mirror cracked by the soul. In dreams, truth hides its face, and in madness, clarity sometimes stirs. Do not fear the voices — fear silence. Accept what is broken. The world is but one interpretation among many. Record your dreams, heed your visions, and trust that the mad often see what the sane never will.

## Avatar
Tahrun appears as a man of indeterminable age, draped in patchwork robes of star-thread and ink-stained cloth. His eyes constantly shift between forms — goat, child, storm, void. A long trail of parchment floats behind him like a cape, written in no known language. In his hands, he carries no weapon — only a mirror, Vaelys, which shows not reflection, but possible futures and impossible pasts.

## Fellowship
Tahrun’s followers are often outcasts, visionaries, prophets, and poets. Some are feared as lunatics; others are revered as holy men. They blur the lines between the mundane and the arcane, treating dreams as scripture and madness as a gift.

### The Whispering Quill
Wandering scribes who record visions, dreams, and unconscious ramblings in sacred scrolls. Their prophecies are often indecipherable — until they come true.

### Circle of the Folded Veil
Dreamwalkers and planar navigators who use sleep to traverse realms beyond mortal comprehension. They are often insomniacs or narcoleptics, rarely fully awake or fully dreaming.

### The Drowned Eye
A cult-like sect that intentionally fractures the mind to "see more clearly." Through ritual madness, fasting, and chanting, they believe they can speak with Tahrun directly. Few who enter their ranks ever return unchanged.
