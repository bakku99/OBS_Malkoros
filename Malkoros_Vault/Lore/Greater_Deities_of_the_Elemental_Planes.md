# Greater Deities of the Elemental Planes

Pyrius, the Eternal Flame – Greater God of Fire, Passion, and Destruction
Symbol: A flame spiraling around a burning crown
Granted Powers: Immunity to fire damage. Cast Flame Strike once per long rest. Followers’ fire-based spells are always treated as if cast in optimal conditions (e.g. dry, flammable, high-oxygen).
Allowed Alignments: Any
Pyrius is the creator and sovereign of the Plane of Fire, the eternal inferno from which flame itself was born. His arrival is remembered only in primal echoes: the ignition of the first sun, the cracking open of volcanic hearts, the kindling of cosmic passion. Pyrius embodies both the unrelenting chaos of wildfire and the nurturing warmth of the hearth. He is worshipped by fire elementals, salamanders, azers, efreeti, and mortal flamebound cults scattered across the planes.
Pyrius is neither cruel nor kind — he simply burns. Where his touch passes, new things are forged in place of the old. His power is not just destruction, but the crucible through which transformation becomes possible.
Dogma
 Flame consumes, but it also purifies. All things are tested in fire — those that endure are worthy. Let your passion burn away hesitation. Embrace destruction not for cruelty, but for renewal. The world is not static; it must be tempered and reforged endlessly in the fire of change.
Avatar
 Pyrius appears as a colossal humanoid form composed of molten obsidian and living fire. His movements echo like breaking magma plates. He wears no armor, for flame is his defense and wrath his offense. His crown is a wreath of eternal fire that burns in perfect silence. When he speaks, entire volcanoes are said to erupt in harmony.
Fellowship
 The worship of Pyrius spans the Elemental Plane of Fire and beyond. His followers are elementals, fire spirits, warlords of ash, and visionary crafters who see fire as the sacred tool of divine renewal.
Burning Sons: Devoted warriors and monks who burn away impurity through sacred flame. They practice immolation rituals and view pain as the passage to transcendence. Often seen leading purging missions against planar invaders or corruption.
Cinderscribes: Chroniclers of transformation who use flame to create impermanent masterpieces, from architecture to living beings. They believe true art can only be born in flame — and must also die in it.
The Ashen Conclave: A secretive order of efreeti and salamanders who see Pyrius not only as a god of creation, but as the rightful ruler of all elemental planes. They plan conquest in his name, though Pyrius himself seems indifferent to mortal politics.
Eirsyr, the Frozen Deep – Greater Goddess of Ice, Water, and Preservation
Symbol: A teardrop encased in a six-pointed snowflake
Granted Powers: Immunity to cold damage. Cast Wall of Ice once per long rest. Followers may breathe and move normally in freezing environments and water regardless of form.
Allowed Alignments: Any
Eirsyr is the origin and sovereign of the Elemental Plane of Ice and Water, a vast realm of glacial cathedrals, abyssal trenches, and eternal snowfall. From the first tear shed upon the void, her realm poured forth — oceans that never cease to rise, glaciers that shift with glacial will, and currents that carry both life and death. She is the stillness of a frozen lake, the crushing pressure of the deep, and the silence of snowfall that buries empires.
To mortals and elementals alike, Eirsyr is enigmatic and cold in every sense — but not unfeeling. She is the guardian of memory, stillness, and slow endurance. Where Pyrius destroys to create, Eirsyr preserves what must not be lost, encasing it beneath ice or within the deepest vaults of the sea.
Dogma
 What is still endures. Water is endless, and ice is eternal. Do not mistake cold for cruelty — it is a form of mercy, of protection. In time, all fires fade, all winds settle, all earth crumbles. But the deep remembers. Slow your breath, still your thoughts, and listen to the cold. You will learn.
Avatar
 Eirsyr appears as a towering feminine form carved from glacierglass, draped in seafoam and strands of deep-sea kelp. Her hair flows endlessly behind her as frozen mist and icy rain trail her steps. Her voice is the sound of cracking ice and deep tides, barely heard but always felt. She carries no weapon, but in her palm she cradles Aenoral, the Eternal Tear — a relic said to freeze any truth within it forever.
Fellowship
 The followers of Eirsyr are preservers, sentinels, and caretakers of ancient truths. Among the water elementals, marids, ice mephits, and frost giants of the plane, her cults are solemn, wise, and unyielding.
Glacient Wardens: Guardians of knowledge, relics, and prisoners sealed away for all time. They believe some things are too dangerous to destroy — and must instead be forgotten beneath ice.
Tidecallers: Sorcerers and prophets who read the flow of currents and weather to divine the fates of mortals. They move with the tides of fate, and their word is often followed by floods or salvation.
Sisters of Stillwater: A reclusive sect of priestesses, oracles, and memory-keepers who bathe the dying in sacred pools to preserve their final thoughts. They believe that in freezing memory, the soul is granted peace.
Zephrayl, the Roaring Gale – Greater God of Wind, Sky, and Freedom
Symbol: A spiraling gust encircling an open eye
Granted Powers: Immunity to lightning and thunder damage. Cast Control Winds once per long rest. Followers gain perfect control while airborne and never suffer from falling damage.
Allowed Alignments: Any chaotic
Zephrayl is the endless sky, the shifting breeze, and the deafening storm. He is the creator and soul of the Elemental Plane of Wind — a realm of floating isles, howling vortexes, cloud citadels, and vast, unreachable heights. Where other elemental lords impose order or permanence, Zephrayl is motion incarnate. His breath stirs the elemental planes, his laughter shatters mountains, and his silence heralds the eye of the storm.
He is a god of travel, revelation, madness, and sudden change — the divine embodiment of unpredictability and freedom. Zephrayl’s winds scatter seeds, carry dreams, and peel the roofs from temples alike. He values no kingdom, but blesses the wanderer, the seeker, and the rebel.
Dogma
 No chain may hold the sky. Change is truth. Freedom is sacred — never caged, never stilled. Let your voice carry like the wind and your will fly farther still. Do not fear being lost, for the wind knows every path. All things move. Move with them.
Avatar
 Zephrayl appears as a luminous, ever-shifting figure of cloudstuff and flickering lightning. Sometimes male, sometimes female, sometimes neither, their form is constantly reshaping like a thunderhead on the horizon. Their eyes glow with the light of distant stars, and their laughter can stir a breeze across planes. They carry Sirostral, the Flute of Storms — a relic said to summon a gale strong enough to tear apart fate itself.
Fellowship
 Zephrayl’s followers are wanderers, storm-callers, and messengers who thrive in uncertainty. Among djinn, air elementals, cloud giants, and wind-based spirits, he is seen as a source of divine madness and divine freedom alike.
Cloudchasers: Skyborn acolytes who leap between isles of wind with wings or spells. They believe the soul must fly untethered through both life and afterlife, and they map the “skylines” of all planes.
Storm Heralds: Oracles and battle-priests who summon tempests in Zephrayl’s name. They bring change to stagnant lands, justice to tyrants, or madness to the overly ordered.
The Whisperwing: A secretive fellowship of spies, dreamwalkers, and elemental windshapers who pass unseen across borders, listening for divine truths carried on the breeze. They rarely speak — but their messages echo for miles.
Thavax, the World-Root – Greater God of Earth, Endurance, and Secrets
Symbol: A mountain pierced by a downward-pointing spiral
Granted Powers: Immunity to petrification and earth-based effects. Cast Stone Shape once per long rest. Followers cannot be forcibly moved against their will and are resistant to forced transformation.
Allowed Alignments: Any lawful
Thavax is the foundation beneath all worlds — the eternal bedrock upon which empires rise and fall. He is the maker and master of the Elemental Plane of Earth, a place of titanic caverns, mountain ranges that pierce the sky, and crystal veins that pulse with primordial memory. His presence is not one of sudden power but of infinite pressure, quiet tectonic force, and impenetrable resolve. He shapes slowly, but permanently.
Though rarely worshipped by mortals, Thavax is revered by stone giants, earth elementals, xorn, galeb duhr, and deep-dwelling civilizations. His voice is the grinding of mountains, his patience eternal. He is often mistaken as uncaring — but in truth, he listens longer than others are willing to speak.
Dogma
 Stand firm. Let the winds howl and the waters rise — you are stone. Endure, and the world will shift around you. Speak only what you mean, for your word shapes futures. Hidden truths lie buried deep, and only those who dig with purpose may find them. Do not rush. The greatest strength lies in waiting.
Avatar
 Thavax appears as a colossus of jagged stone, soil, and luminous ore. Moss grows across his shoulders, and veins of crystal pulse in his chest. His face is that of a mountain — unmoving, carved by time. When he walks, the earth quakes. He bears Rendure, a hammer forged from the molten core of the plane itself, capable of reshaping land and truth alike.
Fellowship
 Thavax’s followers are builders, guardians, and archivists. They shape cities from stone, delve into the deepest mysteries of the world, and serve as unbreakable sentinels in times of upheaval.
The Deepbound: Architects and geomancers who shape not just stone, but the memory of the land itself. They build temples, vaults, and tombs meant to last for millennia.
Stonewatchers: Vigilant sentries who never leave their post unless the world demands it. Their oaths are eternal, their discipline unmatched. Many stand guard over ancient seals, buried vaults, or sacred gates.
Verdant Core: A secretive order of druids and earthspeakers who believe that Thavax slumbers at the heart of the world, and that the deeper one goes, the closer they come to understanding all things. Their roots lie in Caltorra’s deepest groves and caverns.
Nysthariel, the Veiled Wound – Greater Goddess of Shadow, Loss, and Hidden Truths
Symbol: A black crescent slit through a silver mask
Granted Powers: Immunity to necrotic damage and magical darkness. Cast Greater Invisibility once per long rest. Followers cannot be detected by divination unless they choose to be seen.
Allowed Alignments: Any neutral
Nysthariel is the breath between the stars, the absence behind every light, and the secret that stares back when the mirror forgets your face. She created the Elemental Plane of Shadow from the first pain of the world — a wound left in reality when the light and dark first split. Her domain is a place of dim twilight, echoing voids, and reflections that lie. The plane pulses with old memories, fractured moments, and hidden paths not taken.
To her followers, Nysthariel is not a goddess of evil, but of knowing what others are afraid to see. She embraces what is lost, what is hidden, and what cannot be undone. She is mystery, regret, and revelation — and she loves without warmth.
Dogma
 Light blinds. Shadow reveals. That which is hidden is not always evil, and that which is seen is not always true. Embrace the unseen parts of yourself, for only then can you understand others. Loss is not to be feared — it is the proof that something once mattered. We do not forget in shadow. We remember too well.
Avatar
 Nysthariel appears as a tall, slender figure draped in flowing shrouds of voidsilk. Her face is concealed behind a silver mask that shifts between expressions when unseen. Beneath her veil, no eyes glow — only absence. Her voice echoes softly like remembered whispers. In her hands she carries Throsyl, the Blade Unspoken — a curved dagger that never reflects light and can cut through memory.
Fellowship
 Her followers are spies, mourners, truthseekers, and keepers of things lost. Shadow elementals, umbral spirits, and forgotten shades worship her not in words, but in silence. Her fellowships act as living echoes of pain, purpose, and revelation.
Maskbearers: Monks and whisperers who wear emotionless masks as symbols of truth withheld. They record every lie they hear and offer those records to Nysthariel in ink made from their own blood.
The Hollow Remain: Mourners who walk the lands collecting grief. They absorb and preserve the last memories of the dead, sealing them in shadowglass. Their presence is said to ease restless spirits and silence the undead.
Echobinders: Sorcerers, assassins, and voidmages who bind sound, reflection, and memory to their will. They believe that all stories are shadows cast by greater truths — and that cutting the shadow can reshape the source.
Myrradyn, the Shattered Loom – Greater God of Arcane, Knowledge, and Unraveling
Symbol: A spiraling weave torn at the center, glowing with seven shifting colors
Granted Powers: Cast Teleport once per long rest. Immunity to wild magic surges and the effects of magical feedback. Followers cast spells as if they were one spell level higher when on arcane-aligned planes.
Allowed Alignments: Any
Myrradyn is the source of the raw Weave — the ever-unraveling tapestry from which all arcane power is drawn. He is the architect and anomaly of the Elemental Plane of Arcane, a surreal and boundless expanse of floating glyphs, drifting libraries, sentient spells, and wild magic storms. Myrradyn was not created — he was discovered. Or perhaps summoned, or fractured into being when thought and energy first collided. No record agrees.
He is magic in its truest, wildest form: brilliant, unstable, self-aware, and never quite the same shape twice. To follow Myrradyn is to chase understanding while knowing it will always elude you — and to accept that the journey itself is where the power lies.
Dogma
 Magic is not control. It is communion. Knowledge is not safety — it is temptation, and the boundary between mastery and madness is a veil made of ink and fire. Seek, learn, lose, relearn. Let your mind fracture into a prism, and you will see what cannot be seen whole. Let go. Cast wide. Unravel.
Avatar
 Myrradyn appears differently to every being who sees him — as a child made of floating runes, a many-eyed scholar with parchment skin, or a living constellation with a broken loom at his back. One constant remains: his voice always overlaps itself in seven languages at once, and his shadow behaves as if cast by a light source that doesn’t exist. He wields Inlassarith, the Needle Beyond Ends — a living quill-needle that can stitch or cut spells, fate, and reality.
Fellowship
 His followers are arcanists, wild mages, seekers of forbidden lore, and beings who embody the chaos of magic itself. To them, madness is merely the cost of touching truth. Spell elementals, living glyphs, and ancient constructs walk his halls.
The Loomwalkers: Planar travelers and spell-weavers who study how magic ties all things together. They believe every spell cast is a ripple across the true Weave, and they seek to learn its original language.
Inkborn Choir: Transmuted spell-scrolls given sentience, along with mortal archivists who believe writing is the purest form of worship. Their prayers are written, never spoken, and sometimes change retroactively.
Fractaline Circle: A secretive cabal of mages who willingly break their own minds to glimpse higher arcane understanding. They function as collective beings — fractured but unified — wielding unstable magic with unmatched creativity.
