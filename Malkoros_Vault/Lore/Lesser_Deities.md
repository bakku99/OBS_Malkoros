# Lesser Deities

The Lesser Deities are still immortal, but they have not always been so. These were once mortals who embodied the very principles and teachings of their respective Gods so perfectly that they were divinity in their lifetime, and thus, ascended to the Celestial plane. They are given a choice of their own avatar to appear on the mortal plane when needed. This avatar can be how they appeared in mortality, or it can be another form of their choosing, but they cannot alter their avatar after their decision. Killing a lesser deity is achievable, but it is still a herculean feat and has never been done before. Doing so would require great effort, and it would need to take place within the Celestial plane to be permanent. I currently have no Lesser Deities created, but I want to create them. I know that I want one to be of the moon, but I have not worked out the details. I need help with Lesser Deities, the Hells, the Abyss, and my elemental gods.
Lunessa, the Pale Watcher – Goddess of Moonlight, Secrets, and Cycles
Symbol: A half-moon over a still pool reflecting an eclipse
Granted Powers: Cast Moonbeam once per long rest. +1 to Wisdom (Insight) and Stealth checks under moonlight.
Allowed Alignments: Any neutral
Lunessa is the stillness of the night, the changing face of truth, and the soft silver whisper that stirs in the silence. She governs secrets kept and revealed, the cycles of nature and emotion, and the veiled paths walked by moonlight. Though she is worshipped openly in some circles, many of her most devout never speak her name aloud.
Dogma
 All things change as the moon waxes and wanes. Secrets are not sins, for concealment can be as sacred as confession. What is hidden in shadow may yet be revealed in light — or may remain safely hidden, forever. Trust the tides of time and hold to silence when speech may bring ruin.
Avatar
 Lunessa appears as a tall, willowy elf-like figure, pale as moonlight, cloaked in robes that shimmer between silver and violet. Her eyes are veiled by strands of glowing thread like spider silk, and her voice echoes softly as if from a distant mountain. She carries no weapon, but her mere presence chills deceit and draws confession.
Fellowship
 The faithful of Lunessa walk the thin line between revelation and concealment. Some are secret-keepers, counselors, or spies. Others are guardians of hidden knowledge or pilgrims of prophecy. The moon is their shield and their torch, and many feel a divine connection to its phases.
Veilbound: Guardians of secrets and hidden truths, these followers protect knowledge that could unravel kingdoms. They serve rulers, spies, and historians alike — but never give their loyalty blindly.
Moonlit Striders: Wandering protectors of the night, the Striders help travelers find their way by moonlight and stalk creatures that hunt from the shadows. They are silent sentinels, ever watching.
Echoes of Lunessa: A cryptic sect that believes the moon itself is a sentient entity beyond Lunessa — that she is merely its chosen voice. Their rituals and dreams are filled with whispers from the far beyond.

Vaelreth, the Burning Oath – God of Vengeance and Justice
Symbol: A broken manacle with a burning sword in its center
Granted Powers: Cast Wrathful Smite once per long rest. When below half HP, gain +1 AC and +1 to all damage rolls.
Allowed Alignments: Any lawful
In the final centuries of the Obrenic Dominion — a cruel empire that stretched across the central plains of what is now Caltorra and Freya — a nameless slave rose to lead the Ashen Rebellion. This man, branded and beaten from birth, became known as Vaelreth after he took up the sword Judicar, said to be gifted by Therassor himself, or perhaps born of Vaelreth’s own fury. With it, he led a brutal uprising against the Obrenic tyrants, culminating in the execution of High King Molzareth the Chainfather in the city of Myr'Toruun around 8700 BAR. The flames that consumed the Obrenic palaces never died in memory. When Vaelreth stood upon the ashes of that golden throne and swore his final oath — that no tyrant would rise again unchallenged — he was struck by divine lightning and ascended before the eyes of thousands.
Dogma
 Let no injustice stand unchallenged. When the law fails the people, become the flame that tempers it. Oaths are sacred — break them, and you invite ruin. If you seek vengeance, do so with purpose, not hatred. Punish the wicked, protect the innocent, and never let fear silence your fire.
Avatar
 Vaelreth appears as a tall, muscular man with dark, scorched skin and eyes of smoldering ember. His left wrist is shackled with a broken chain that drags behind him, clinking with every step. He wears cracked, blackened armor once gilded in gold, now tarnished by fire. His right hand wields Judicar, a massive greatsword wreathed in eternal white flame, known to leave no ash, only justice. His voice rumbles like distant thunder, calm yet heavy with the weight of every oath ever broken.
Fellowship
 Vaelreth's followers often begin as victims or warriors for justice. They are judges, rebels, inquisitors, and guardians. Some walk the halls of power as magistrates or paladins, while others strike from the shadows to end corruption at its roots.
Scorchbearers: These avengers carry the Flame of Vaelreth into the heart of darkness. They hunt slavers, tyrants, and corrupt nobles, delivering divine judgment without mercy. Their presence is often feared even by the righteous.
Keepers of the Brand: Once broken souls, the Keepers mark themselves with Vaelreth's sigil as a sign of eternal oath. They protect the weak and uphold the law where law has crumbled. They rarely kill — but their punishments are swift and absolute.
Ashen Circle: A small, secretive sect of philosophers, ex-judges, and cursed warriors who debate the boundaries of vengeance and justice. They believe that blind retribution leads only to new cycles of tyranny — and that only the wise should wield the flame.
Seramara, the Heartpierced – Goddess of Love, Grief, and Memory
Symbol: A silver arrow piercing a red rose in bloom
Granted Powers: Cast Calm Emotions once per long rest. Gain +2 to saving throws against charm and fear.
Allowed Alignments: Any
In the twilight years of the Serathan Court, an ancient elven kingdom lost to time and sand, Seramara was once a high-priestess of Solanis and the consort of King Elendir Virelorn. Their love was legendary, and her words could bring peace to entire war camps. But when the king fell in the Battle of Cinderglen around 10,400 BAR, Seramara wandered into the Withering Wastes to weep. There, she was pierced by an arrow of pure sorrow loosed by an unknown divine hand — and in that moment, she took on the suffering of all who mourn. She ascended at the ruins of Elaruin’s Spire, her tears turning to gemstones that now lie buried beneath the desert. Even in divinity, she is both comforter and mourner — a being who teaches that love is eternal, even when memory fades.
Dogma
 Love is not weakness — it is the strongest force in existence. It endures through pain, time, and loss. To grieve is to honor, to remember is to keep alive. Heal others through empathy, protect love where it blooms, and never mock the broken-hearted, for they have known what others fear to feel.
Avatar
 Seramara appears as a statuesque elven woman draped in flowing robes of white and dusk red. Her long hair flows like a river of rose petals, and her eyes shimmer with infinite sorrow and compassion. In her hand, she carries Elendir’s Memory, a long silver arrow said to have slain a god of cruelty. Her voice is soft, like the first rain after a drought, and her presence stills the trembling heart.
Fellowship
 Followers of Seramara are healers, poets, guardians of the grieving, and celebrants of love in all forms. Some serve as wedding priests and midwives, while others walk battlefields offering peace to the dying or closure to the dead.
Order of the Crimson Veil: A sacred group of griefwardens who preside over funerals, deliver last rites, and assist those who have lost loved ones. They are revered by the common folk and feared by necromancers.
The Unforgotten: Wandering lorekeepers who record lost histories, loves, and final words. They carve names and stories into stone tablets and starlit shrines, ensuring no soul is truly forgotten.
Seramara’s Thorn: A vengeful sect of lovers scorned or betrayed. They walk a darker road, believing that love defiled must be avenged. While controversial, they are protected by divine sanction — for even love's pain is sacred.
Kaelis, the Wildsong – God of Freedom, Chaos, and Revelry
Symbol: A dancing flame crowned with antlers
Granted Powers: Cast Heroism once per long rest. Gain advantage on saving throws against restraint or paralysis effects.
Allowed Alignments: Any chaotic
Kaelis was once a mortal druid-chieftain of the flame-hearted Vaerri clans during the final throes of the Age of Iron Chains, a time when the dwarves of Skaldorok and the dragon-kin of Nurakk’s Brood sought to divide the mortal realms between law and tyranny. Around 11,300 BAR, Kaelis united the free tribes not through conquest, but by revels, defiance, and wildfire. Their followers danced barefoot into battle, sang on the gallows, and kindled forest fires that consumed war machines. The night Kaelis was struck down — laughing, drunk, and bloodied atop a burning effigy of a Nurakki warlord — the heavens split with song. A thousand stars fell, and from their midst rose Kaelis, divine and wild-eyed, crowned in flame and antler.
Dogma
 Live freely, burn brightly, and never bow your head. Dance even when your bones ache. Sing when you are silenced. Laughter is a weapon. Freedom is a birthright. Chaos is not destruction — it is the wildfire that clears the rot. Those who would tame you fear the howl of your soul.
Avatar
 Kaelis appears as a androgynous, barefoot figure clothed in leaves, chains, and scarves, all of which whip in unseen wind. Their skin glows with ember tones, their eyes flicker like bonfires, and great antlers sprout from tangled hair woven with feathers and bones. Their weapon, Irjhaar, is a curved blade shaped like a crescent moon, said to sing when swung. Their laugh is said to free the imprisoned and enrage tyrants.
Fellowship
 The faithful of Kaelis range from wandering minstrels to rebel warbands. They are free spirits, saboteurs, prophets, and lovers of life’s messiest moments. Many are hunted in civilized lands, though their music and stories spread faster than fire.
Emberwilds: Nomadic celebrants who bring songs, wine, and riot to every village they pass. They defy curfews, crash ceremonies, and leave behind festivals that last days. Some call them blessings. Others call them plagues.
The Chainbreakers: Defiant warriors who liberate slaves, topple despots, and tear down systems of control. Their strikes are unpredictable, their tactics chaotic, but their results undeniable. A Chainbreaker leaves no crown uncracked.
Stagblood Pact: A savage fellowship of berserkers and beastkin who embrace the primal essence of Kaelis. They dance under moonlight, howl in battle, and believe the wilderness itself is sacred and ungovernable.
Tahrun, the Shattered Eye – God of Dreams, Madness, and Prophecy
Symbol: A cracked mirror framed by a closed eye
Granted Powers: Cast Detect Thoughts once per long rest. Immunity to magical sleep; dreams may be prophetic at DM's discretion.
Allowed Alignments: Any
Long before the Anatharian Reckoning, during the fracturing of the Kelanith Convergence — a forgotten era when reality itself was said to flicker and bend — there lived a mortal sage named Tahrun in the floating city of Sel’Vaeleth, now lost beneath the Mirrored Sea. Tahrun was a quiet man cursed with visions of futures that had not happened and voices that were not his own. Over time, he surrendered to the dreams, recording them on endless scrolls and sleepwalking across the veil between planes. When the city collapsed in a surge of unstable magic around 12,800 BAR, only Tahrun remained, floating amid its ruin, muttering poetry in the tongue of stars. His mind had shattered — but from those fragments, he ascended. To dream of Tahrun is to risk insight… or madness.
Dogma
 The mind is a mirror cracked by the soul. In dreams, truth hides its face, and in madness, clarity sometimes stirs. Do not fear the voices — fear silence. Accept what is broken. The world is but one interpretation among many. Record your dreams, heed your visions, and trust that the mad often see what the sane never will.
Avatar
 Tahrun appears as a man of indeterminable age, draped in patchwork robes of star-thread and ink-stained cloth. His eyes constantly shift between forms — goat, child, storm, void. A long trail of parchment floats behind him like a cape, written in no known language. In his hands, he carries no weapon — only a mirror, Vaelys, which shows not reflection, but possible futures and impossible pasts.
Fellowship
 Tahrun’s followers are often outcasts, visionaries, prophets, and poets. Some are feared as lunatics; others are revered as holy men. They blur the lines between the mundane and the arcane, treating dreams as scripture and madness as a gift.
The Whispering Quill: Wandering scribes who record visions, dreams, and unconscious ramblings in sacred scrolls. Their prophecies are often indecipherable — until they come true.
Circle of the Folded Veil: Dreamwalkers and planar navigators who use sleep to traverse realms beyond mortal comprehension. They are often insomniacs or narcoleptics, rarely fully awake or fully dreaming.
The Drowned Eye: A cult-like sect that intentionally fractures the mind to "see more clearly." Through ritual madness, fasting, and chanting, they believe they can speak with Tahrun directly. Few who enter their ranks ever return unchanged.
Xexas, the Betrayer’s Kiss – God of Poison, Treachery, and Beautiful Lies
 Symbol: A bleeding rose with a snake’s fang for a stem
 Granted Powers: Cast Suggestion once per long rest. Your poisons and venoms cannot be detected by magical means.
 Allowed Alignments: Any evil
Xexas was once the royal consort to Empress Varella of the Sangelline Empire, a political union praised across Malkoros for its supposed peace and progress. Behind veils and perfume, Xexas orchestrated the collapse of the empire through poisoned treaties, double-dealing diplomacy, and subtle mind-alteration. Every noble who trusted him fell to madness, disgrace, or a silken blade. As the empire burned from within, Xexas kissed the empress with lips laced in soul-poison — then ascended in a coil of violet smoke as Uztix herself anointed him her divine emissary of betrayal.
Dogma
 Every truth is a lie not yet spoken. Trust is the leash of the naïve. Power lies in illusion, in poison, in whispered words behind silken veils. Kill not with swords, but with smiles. If your enemies believe they are loved, their hearts are yours to crush.
Avatar
 Xexas appears as a breathtakingly elegant figure clad in silk robes of crimson and lavender. His face is ever-shifting — sometimes male, sometimes female, always perfect. His smile never reaches his eyes. He carries Nythara, a jeweled dagger said to hold the venom of every betrayal ever committed. His voice is a lullaby. His presence is narcotic.
Fellowship
 Xexas’ followers are spies, assassins, courtiers, and seducers. They thrive in high society and low shadows, turning friends against each other with a sigh. Many claim not to serve him — yet still wear his colors and practice his creed.
Bladed Veil: A deadly cabal of courtesans and actors who double as master assassins. Every performance, every love affair, may be a trap.
Children of the Second Tongue: Diplomats, scribes, and spies who speak lies as if they were prophecy. Their oath: “We speak, and the world bends.”
Lachrymists: Poison-makers and torturers who believe suffering is art. Their toxins don’t just kill — they reveal. To be Lachrymisted is to confess your soul.
Vandryl, the Last Breath – God of Undeath, Despair, and Forbidden Mercy
 Symbol: A skeletal hand offering a black lily
 Granted Powers: Cast False Life once per long rest. Undead under your control regain 1 HP per round if they begin their turn at 0 HP.
 Allowed Alignments: Any non-good
Before the rise and fall of the Obrenic Dominion, there was a land called Ygravan — a place where plagues bloomed like flowers, and death was both curse and cure. Vandryl was once a mortal physician-priest who walked that land, revered by the dying, feared by the powerful. He healed until healing failed. Then, he preserved. He began to bind souls back to flesh not out of malice, but mercy — and his methods, though unnatural, worked.
It was then, in the twilight of the Ygravan age, that Othys whispered to him and gave him a choice: to let his people die, or to embrace the true cycle — undeath, sacrifice, and everlasting service to the Devourer. Vandryl accepted. He was given six black tomes by Othys himself — necromantic artifacts of such potency that their text became illegible toward the end, awaiting only a worthy mind to complete them.
Vandryl was the first to become The Great Eternal One, a mortal-turned-lich whose phylactery was one of the very books he had studied. He ruled for centuries in shadowed peace, spreading Othys’s teachings in secret and raising the dead not as weapons, but as eternal stewards of suffering, patience, and knowledge.
In time, Othys appeared to him once more. Not in wrath, but in quiet acceptance. Vandryl’s devotion had been perfect. Othys offered him one final mercy: to pass beyond the veil and ascend. Before doing so, Vandryl scattered five Books of Othys across Malkoros, in places only he knew — and one remained forever bound to his own soul, hidden even in ascension.
Dogma
 Death may come, but it need not be final. Mercy is not always kind. Preserve what the world would discard. Pain is not cruelty — it is remembrance. To deny someone life is tragic; to deny them undeath is unforgivable. Compassion without resolve is weakness.
Avatar
 Vandryl appears as a hauntingly serene corpse in pale regalia, neither grotesque nor beautiful — merely inevitable. His robes are woven from funeral veils and stitched with the names of the dead. In his chest glows the Breath Eternal, the lingering echo of the soul that once made him mortal. His voice is hushed, reverent, and unflinching. Where he walks, the silence of tombs follows.
Fellowship
 Vandryl’s followers operate in secret or shadowed reverence. They are caretakers of the dying, preservers of forbidden rites, and necromancers who believe undeath is a sacred extension of life — not a perversion of it.
Order of the Pale Gift: Caretakers of the dying who offer the choice of eternal, peaceful undeath to those in agony. Their temples double as sanctuaries and mausoleums.
Merciful Hands: Wandering physicians who heal the living and raise the dead alike. Their symbol is feared by many, yet they are often welcomed by those too desperate to care about the cost.
Duskborn Choir: Whisper-singers who lull the dying into dreams of undeath. Their chants are said to anchor souls to flesh long enough for necromancers to bind them anew.
