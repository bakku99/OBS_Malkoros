# Lesser Deities

The Lesser Deities are still immortal, but they have not always been so. These were once mortals who embodied the very principles and teachings of their respective Gods so perfectly that they were divinity in their lifetime, and thus, ascended to the Celestial plane. They are given a choice of their own avatar to appear on the mortal plane when needed. This avatar can be how they appeared in mortality, or it can be another form of their choosing, but they cannot alter their avatar after their decision. Killing a lesser deity is achievable, but it is still a herculean feat and has never been done before. Doing so would require great effort, and it would need to take place within the Celestial plane to be permanent. I currently have no Lesser Deities created, but I want to create them. I know that I want one to be of the moon, but I have not worked out the details. I need help with Lesser Deities, the Hells, the Abyss, and my elemental gods.

Mortals who embodied their Greater Deity's teachings with such piety that they were given Ascension and granted Divinity. These would be akin to Demigods. Internal links are provided to the respective Deity files.
