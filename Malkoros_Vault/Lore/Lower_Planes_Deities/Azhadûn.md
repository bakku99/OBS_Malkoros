# Azhadûn

Azhadûn, the Crimson Warden – Greater God of Tyranny, Contracts, and Damnation

Azhadûn is the creator and sovereign of the Nine Hells — the vast infernal hierarchy of burning courts, iron cities, endless dungeons, and forges of punishment. He is law made cruelty, justice twisted into domination. It was Azhadûn who first carved order from the chaos of the lower void, branding each layer of Hell with his name and decree. No soul is damned by accident — all who fall under his domain have agreed to something, even if they didn’t know the price.
He does not rage. He does not lie. He writes. He binds. He judges. His dominion is absolute — not through strength, but through structure. He is the ultimate contract, the last loophole, the unbreakable clause.

## Dogma
 All power is earned through service, and all service is bound in oath. Choice is an illusion until it is signed in blood. Mercy is weakness. Freedom is chaos. Bind what you conquer. Rule what you bind. Let none escape their obligations — not even yourself.

## Avatar
 Azhadûn appears as a towering figure in segmented black-gold armor, draped in crimson judicial robes trimmed with glowing infernal script. His face is concealed behind a sculpted mask of law and fire, never removed. In one hand, he carries Inquisitus, the Rod of Eternal Accord — a staff that brands truths into reality. His voice is absolute: when he speaks, all else falls silent.

## Fellowship
 The worship of Azhadûn is strict, ritualized, and ancient. Devils are his enforcers, judges, jailers, scribes, and conquerors. Mortal cults to Azhadûn often form within authoritarian regimes, tyrannical orders, or among ambitious mages seeking eternal contracts.

### The Chainforged
Devils of the lower circles who serve as enforcers of infernal law. Their chains are sentient, wrapping around liars and oathbreakers without command.

### Accorded Eyes
Infernal scribes, both mortal and fiendish, who draft contracts, wills, and magical bindings. Their quills are dipped in soul-ink, and their work is said to last even beyond death.

### The Order of the Final Clause
Judges and arch-devils who believe every soul will eventually serve Azhadûn — willingly or not. They offer terms of salvation, knowing that damnation lies in the fine print.
