# Ulvaarak

Ulvaarak, the Howling Maw – Greater God of Madness, Ruin, Chaos and Endless Hunger

Ulvaarak is chaos incarnate — the yawning madness at the core of the Abyssal Plane. He did not create the Abyss — he is the Abyss. Born of the screaming remnants of forgotten gods devoured in the first divine wars, Ulvaarak exists as an ever-shifting mass of insanity, hunger, and blasphemy. He is every scream never answered, every wound never healed, every madness never named.
He does not rule the Abyss. He is its will — fractured, howling, and eternal. Each demon lord is merely a shard of his broken psyche, clawing for dominance in a place where meaning has no place. He is feared even by his own creations, and worshipped not with prayer, but with slaughter.

## Dogma
 Tear. Ruin. Feed. There is no order, no truth, no purpose but destruction. Creation is a lie. Civilization is a cage. You are the claw through which Ulvaarak gnaws the world. Laugh as you kill. Scream as you die. You are already part of him.

## Avatar
 Ulvaarak has no fixed form. His most common manifestation is a titanic, shifting amalgam of wings, fangs, limbs, and ever-screaming mouths. His presence corrupts air, stone, and sanity alike. When he must speak, his voice speaks through his followers — a thousand mouths screaming at once in different tongues, all agreeing in violence. His weapon is Abyssgrin, a serrated fang the size of a cathedral, which appears only when he wishes a world consumed.

## Fellowship
 Ulvaarak's "followers" are cults of madness, demonic broods, and warbands of destruction. His essence bleeds into all chaos, his whispers crawl beneath every massacre, and his name is carved in blood wherever meaning collapses.

### Maws of the Thousand
Cults of cannibalistic prophets who believe each act of devouring brings them closer to being “swallowed back” into the Maw.

### Gorehowlers
Screaming berserkers and demonic warlords who tear open the veil between planes through sheer violence. They fight not for conquest, but to ruin the very concept of victory.

### Children of Shard-Flesh
Demonic savants who sew different pieces of Ulvaarak’s will into flesh, creating warped “prophets” of madness. They do not speak — their bodies pulse with ritual screams encoded in muscle.
