# Malkoros Calendar

The calendar of Malkoros is an ancient and intricate reckoning of time, born from divine influence and cosmic balance. It is widely used across the mortal world and demarcates time using a 14-period lunar year, two orbiting moons, and an 8-day week. This calendar stretches from the year -3000 B.A.R. to 3000 A.R., centered around - Before Anatharian Reckoning (B.A.R.), the first recorded history of civilization with the establishment of the Anatharian Empire - and the Anatharian Reckoning (A.R.), a pivotal epoch of divine withdrawal, marking a shift from negative year integers to positive year integers with the fall of the Anatharian Empire causing a dark period and loss of information.
## Calendar Fundamentals
### Epochs:
#### B.A.R. ‚Äî Before Anatharian Reckoning
#### A.R. ‚Äî After Anatharian Reckoning
There is no year 0; the system jumps directly from -1 B.A.R. to 1 A.R.
### Days in a Year: 400 standard
### Leap Year: Every 5 years adds 1 day to the final month (Vellundas)
### Leap Rule: Year divisible by 5 (except year 0, which is skipped)
### Months: 14 named periods
### Week Length: 8-day cycle
### Total Year Range: -3000 B.A.R. to 3000 A.R.
### Weekdays (Lunar Week)
Malkoros recognizes an 8-day lunar week, said to be based on the divine cycle of lesser godlings and astral currents:
#### Myraen
#### Tharnis
#### Vuldran
#### Silmora
#### Kelvorn
#### Hearthol
#### Drelmora
#### Oswen
Weekday calculation accounts for leap years, skipped year zero, and applies consistently across both epochs.


### Lunar Calendar
Two moons influence Malkoros‚Äôs tides, magic, and mythologies:
#### Lyccara ‚Äì The swift moon (Cycle: 20 days)
 Always visible in folklore and tied to transformation and primal forces.
#### Nerunel ‚Äì The veiled moon (Cycle: 33 days, Shifted by 10 days)
 Mysterious and long-cycled, tied to fate, shadow, and prophecy.
Lunar Mechanics
Malkoros orbits are tracked using Epoch Days ‚Äî the total number of days since calendar day zero (Year -3000, Month 1, Day 1). The epoch day accounts for:

Skipped Year 0
Leap day offsets

This precision allows for accurate moon phase prediction across eras.
##### Phases (1‚Äì8):
New Moon
Evening Crescent
First Quarter
Waxing Gibbous
Full Moon
Waning Gibbous
Last Quarter
Morning Crescent
Phase is calculated per moon using fractional position in cycle, duration, and shift.

| 9   | Umbarkeen  | 24   |                             |
| 10  | Umberveil  | 30   | Trial of Veils              |
| 11  | Raencrest  | 26   |                             |
| 12  | Cindervail | 28   | Emberfall (28th)            |
| 13  | Lumirian   | 30   | Dawnmoot (1st)              |
| 14  | Vellundas  | 38   | Ashwake (38th), +1 leap day |

On leap years, **Vellundas gains a 39th day**:  
**‚ÄúThe Wandering Moon‚Äù** ‚Äî a rare omen-bearing day said to open doors between realms.

Cultural Notes
Ashwake, on the final day of Vellundas, marks the spiritual end of the year. When the Wandering Moon appears during leap years, it is said to herald rare fate-woven births, strange omens, or divine interference.
The Bleeding Moon of Lycanos is often associated with blood rites, chaos, or lunar awakenings ‚Äî especially tied to lycanthropes or demonic lore.
Festivals like Verdance Eve and Circle Reawakening celebrate seasonal change and nature‚Äôs renewal, aligned with druids and Circle traditions.
