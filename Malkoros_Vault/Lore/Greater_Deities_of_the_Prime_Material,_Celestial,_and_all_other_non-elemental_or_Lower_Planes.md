# Greater Deities of the Prime Material, Celestial, and all other non-elemental or Lower Planes

Greater Deities are and always have been. They are truly immortal unless very specific, highly unlikely circumstances were to occur. They are the creators of the universe that Malkoros inhabits, and they are the creators of all planes of existence other than the Elemental planes (Created by the Elemental Gods) and the Lower planes (Created by the Greater Devils and Abyssals/Demons).

Solanis, God of Light and Life

Symbol: Gold disk embossed with a blazing sun.
Granted Powers: Cast light twice per day, turn undead as if one level higher
Allowed alignments: Any good
Priests of Solanis are welcome in almost any town, and are often considered to be good luck. This god is favorably viewed by commoners, and his worship is widespread.
Dogma
Solanis is the great light of goodness that shines upon all. He gives light and life, strengthening the good of heart. He admonishes the darkness, burning away evil and unlife with his radiance. So to must we shine upon the world, the holy embodiments of his will and light. Live every day to the fullest, and in doing so, set an example for all people, so that life is never a gift to be taken for granted.
Avatar
Solanis appears as a great lord of light and life. He stands tall and serene, yet a great sense of strength and purpose is felt in his form. His age is undeterminable, though older than youth and younger than elder. His eyes blaze golden as the sun, his hair a corona of light. He wears blazing robes of yellow with few adornments.
Fellowship
The clerics and followers of Solanis tend to use magics of enlightenment, knowledge, healing, and protection. Their work is benevolent, bringing light and hope to people while casting back the darkness. They excel at working against the undead.
The fellowships of Solanis include the following:

Eyes of the Blazing Sun: The Eyes seek out darkness in the world, be it of the heart or of the undead. They bring forth the words and will of Solanis to aid the world. These followers travel the world widely, erecting and maintaining churches and temples in many towns and cities. They are wise sages who balance charitable works, preaching, and warring against evil. This is the largest of Solanis' fellowships, with large temples in Isodora, Dramfark, Freya, and Lumella.

Society of Luminaries: The Society seeks to understand the darkness and light in the world. These loremasters maintain incredible libraries of knowledge regarding the cosmos, the struggles of man against demons, and the enlightenment of angels. The Society includes a wide range of tradesmen and artisans such as bookbinders, painters, and singers. Some remain in seclusion in the churches of the Eyes, documenting their words and copying the words of Solanis for others. Other members travel the world singing of the tales of Solanis and the writers. If ever a warrior needed to understand how to defeat darkness, it is said this Society either knows or can get the information. This fellowship binds the various sects of Solanis.

Dawnbringers: Secretive and wary, the Dawnbringers infiltrate warrens of darkness to destroy and banish evil from the world. As their name states, they bring the light of Solanis into the heart of eternal night to bear it away. Their numbers are never truly known, though some of the greatest battles and cataclysmic events have been noted as the final acts of the Dawnbringers. Some of Solanis' brethren consider the sect as insane and foolish while others pray for their safety and good works.

Knights of Aina'rutha: These knights are powerful clerics who seek to end the tyranny and evil of the dark and undead. The Aina'rutha, or Holy Anger, was founded by two clerics: Gilmandrion, priest of Solanis, and Amiolia, priestess of Solanis. The two met in Vanulum to answer the aid of the council under attack by dark forces. Together, they worked to banish the darkness and heal the injured. After the terror passed, the two spoke with others and soon a following was formed. Members typically are elven and human, though some dwarves have come to the call.

Therassor - God of Righteous Battle

Symbol: A steel disk embossed with a shining sword.
Granted Powers: cast flame blade once per day. +1 to hit.
Allowed alignments: Any good
As the god of just battle, Therassor is popular among knights, and many otherwise non-religious soldiers and warriors will invoke his name on the battlefield.
Clerics of Therassor often work hand-in-hand with the armies of good-aligned secular governments. As relatively little emphasis is placed on religious services, many of this god's clerics may actually serve as ;holy warriors; to their respective crowns. It is not uncommon to see a cleric hold an officer's title, as they are well-versed in the teachings of battlefield tactics as well as personal combat.
Dogma
With steel drawn, do we enter the field of battle. Our foe, we see before us. The call of Therassor beckons us. And we must answer. Singular of action. Honored of duty. To arms for the Honored General.
Avatar
He is an able-bodied warrior armored in ancient platemail. On his hip, he wears the Ivory Sword, a shaped piece of light and power. His face is rugged and scarred from many battles. His hazel eyes are sad yet strong.
Fellowship
The clerics and followers of Therassor depend on their strength and ability in battles more than magics. Any magics they use are for combat, healing, protection, and guarding.
The fellowships of Therassor include the following:

Warders of the Gate: The Warders are warrior-clerics who defend the line against darkness and evil. Strong of arm and heart, they face the oncoming darkness wrought in the world by man and beast. Their numbers are found among the greatest of cities and nations and the most quiet and peaceful of villages. This is the largest of Therassor's fellowships with many city guards, warriors, ethical mercenaries, and lords turning to his worship.

Governors of Battle: The Governors are tacticians of battle. These warriors begin as scribes and work their way up through a rigorous knighthood to become members. Their studies not only include warfare but the best routes for supplies, keeping wars from overwhelming the populace, the best use of numbers against various odds, and the political meanderings of treaties. They are a holy order seeking to balance honor and dignity with warfare and safety. Although these warriors adhere to a stringent set of rules, they rarely allow the prestige to go to their head. Governors are found among the human nations.

Ghardankuldar (Stalwart Warriors): Born in the dwarven halls of Hughfaruhm and Degh Kuldohr, the warlike dwarves fought amongst themselves and others. As the blood flowed like rivers under the great mountains, the wise warchiefs sought a moral code to follow to end the chaos and strengthen their warriors against outside threats. Coming in a vision was Therassor, guised as the dwarven warrior-king Ghardan Aglar (Stalwart Blade). He battled their greatest of warriors and granted them with his teachings. Their sense of honor awakened, they gathered into an incredible force seeking to bring down the tyranny of poor leaders, end the unethical fighting of mercenaries, and stop the dark tide of Othys's armies. Now many humans have joined the Stalwart Warriors.

Othys - God of Death

Symbol: A grinning skull.
Nickname: The Devourer, The Walker of Shadows
Granted powers: All undead under PC control have +1 HP per die.
Allowed alignments: Any may follow the God of Death.
Othys is said to be the keeper of the underworld and ruler of hells, though that is not true. Though many think of him as an evil entity, others recognize that death is part of the circle of life and should be embraced, not condemned. While there are temples throughout Malkoros dedicated to Othys, worshippers might be frowned upon or thought of as eccentric and avoidable characters.
Dogma
The Walker of Shadows takes all from life to the lands of shade and rest, for his lands are of the dead. Death is the night as life is the day; one cannot exist without the other. Some seek a bloody end, others peaceful and quiet. But all come before the Devourer eventually.
Avatar
Othys appears as a young man of charcoal skin and pale white eyes. Long tendrils of black hair float around him as he waits patiently for the end. He wears a mix of armor and robes the colors of midnight trimmed in a deep green. Upon his breast lies the Vial of Night, holding the twisted and turned tears of Solanis. Only the Walker of Shadows knows what they will do, though many wonder and question.
Fellowship
The clerics and followers of Othys employ necromatic magics mixed with guardian to bring the living and themselves closer to the dead and undead.
The paths of Othys include the following:

Attendants of the Rapture: The Attendents are the largest group of Othys's paths. This path teaches the loving touch of death as the end of one life for another. These are the keepers of Othys's realm, the land of shade and rest. Their words are comforting, inviting the end through an acceptance of Othys's sweet and kind embrace, to take the Walker of Shadows as a lover and lord. The churches of the Attendents include many symbols of peace and tranquility, of acceptance and ascension. The Attendants believe to join with Othys is to acheive ultimate peace and balance. The path also keeps and performs the funeral rites for the dead or dying. Some of the followers of other dieties have sought the Attendants to aid them in the passing of their own. This path may be found throughout the lands of man and elf, with a scant few in the lands of dwarf and gnome.

Dark Hand: Members of the Dark Hand take a dark road of death, delivering its chill touch to those they deem worthy. These are the judges, the dividers of the way. Their methods are questionable and bent, gaining the fear and loathing of most of the pantheon and people of Malkoros. Their techniques include torture, deprevation, and bloodletting. And those that receive their dark gift are those who meet the sometimes twisted, other times coldly calculating, sense of worth. The numbers of this path grow and dwindle without any clear reason. They are found typically around the human nations, the various mines of Dramfark, and the Underdark nations.

Dragons of Smoke: The path of Dragons bespeaks of anger and vengence. This is the dark and dangerous face of Othys. The Dragons are assassins without compare, seeking to deliver the taste and pain of death with a swift stroke. They believe they fulfill Othys's anger and pain against those who deserve death as their only punishment. The souls taken by these killers are tied to their killer by Othys's will. The assassins then teach the soul through whisperings and deeds of why they have been killed and the blessing of their return as followers of the Devourer, for they have been chosen to be his brood. Few know of these followers, these hand-picked and trained assassins. Their numbers are few but powerful. Elves, Dwarves, Tieflings, and Men who have fallen from the light and have stony-hearts are typically chosen by Othys for this path. Never again will they serve another.

Atotz - Goddess of Luck

Symbol: A ring of small silver stars
Granted powers: Cast bless 1long rest. Gain +1 to all saving throws.
Allowed alignments: Any chaotic
Atotz is, quite simply put, Lady Luck. Her devoters are bold, brave, and somewhat reckless. Luck is the only thing that they rely on, even though it sometimes fails them.
Dogma
Chance and luck are the virtues of the spritely of heart, keen of eye, and merry of soul. The way of melancholy and fear are not within our power. To tip the scales, to surmount the impossible, to taste heaven, to escape with riches from hell...these are the realms of delight and danger we seek like a thirsty man for water in Bellark's dunes.
Avatar
Atotz is one of the deitries who most enjoys visiting the world in mortal form, and appears as an elven or human lady with fiery hair and glittering green eyes. Her eyes seem to giggle and laugh while her face seems reflective when met by adventurers. Her dress differs constantly, depending on her moods, from layers of skirts and finery to practical travelling leathers. She tends to always wear a scarf and pair of gloves in scarlet. On her left hand, she wears the Ring of Zimbus, an artifact of the great bard Zimbus whose songs still fill the small gems of the ring.
Fellowship
The clerics and followers of Atotz tend to use magics to help them accomplish impossible tasks. Their uses of charm, divination, and blessings are among the best. They meld their use of magic with diverse abilities to help them change the fortunes of the world.
The fellowships of Atotz are much more loosely organized than those of many other religions, and include the following:

Spinning Stars: These followers seek to become bright and shining stars of Atotz. The largest group of worshippers, the Stars walk the world seeking to understand the loving and fickle nature that is fortune and chance. Their views are the basis of Atotz's teachings. One of the largest of Atotz's churches run by the Stars is a gambling house and temple in Taavine, Lumella.

Laughing Maidens: This all-female group travels the world teaching newcomers to the open road what it trully means to be an adventurer. Many of these women began as serving wenches and daughters of great warriors that did not understand why only men could adventure. Each of them left the safety of their homes and found a common following of other women who loved the freedom of the road. Members of this group meet in taverns throughout Malkoros, with the largest congregation forming in The Glades.

Lovers of Fortune: Many people believe the Lovers are one of the most frightening and stupid groups of people on the face of Malkoros. These followers of Atotz literally throw themselves into dangerous situations, be it leaping from tall cliffs, mooing like a cow to a minotaur, or running into a dragon's maw. It is through their acceptance of chance and the luck of their goddess that they survive. Though, the course of the Lovers' history includes many who have fallen in the service of the Scarlet Mistress.

Hostus- God of Nature

Symbol: Rigid stone disk portraying a large tree.
Granted powers: All beasts have no worse than a neutral reaction. Cast entangle 1long rest.
Allowed alignments: Any non-evil
Hostus is the patron god of the Elves, as well as the lord of nature in Malkoros. His followers are powerful in nature, focusing themselves on the healing and control of nature rather than combat. He is the father of seasons, the center of the world, the wisdom of trees and stone. Hostus is worshipped abundantly in Caltorra but renown all over Malkoros.
Dogma
Nature is the way of survival, of beauty, of ugliness. Through becoming one with nature, we shall understand the world. Through understanding the world, we shall grow strong and wise as the ancient oaks. To be one with nature is to be one with growth and destruction: for each peaceful act, their is an opposite of angry retribution.
Avatar
Hostus appears as a young elven man, strong of body. He stands tall and thick as the ancient trees of his forests. His hair shimmers in flaxen colors of sunlight. His eyes mirror the depths of lakes. Hostus wears mismatched leathers and bits and pieces from his forests, such as leaves and feathers. He carries with him the Staff of Forests, a root with a golden leaf carved within it.
Fellowship
The clerics and followers of Hostus tend toward magics that aid them in working with and controlling animals, plants, and the elements.
The Fellowships of Hostus include the following:

Eyes of Creation: The Eyes watch and protect all of nature. They can be found within all environments from urban cities to desolate plains. They see beauty and pain in all settings of nature. Through their patient work, they seek to aid life in those areas, to help it survive and thrive against the dangers of encroaching man or the changes of time.

Dancers of the Oak: The Dancers take great joy in nature, the power and beauty of it. These followers tend to be beautiful in some way, be it of features or art. They seek to touch all of nature, to enhance its beauty and life, to heal and nuture. Each season of spring, they gather around oak trees, dancing in the moonlight and weaving ribbons of greens, golds, and pinks. If the year proves to be favorable, the ribbons blossom into flowers and vines the next morning.

Witchlings of the Night: The Witchlings are a group that the followers of Hostus wish they could forget. When Hostus tasted Othys's tongue and blood, a dark seed of anger and treachery blossomed in the lord of nature. When he spat forth that tongue and seed into the earth, fires erupted and birthed a child of dark nature. This child gathered followers of Othys, who believe nature is dangerous, beautiful, and deadly. To this day, this small and secretive sect works to destroy all creations of civilization, and then replace them with their ideal of nature.

Ineas - Goddess of Knowledge

Symbol: An open book with an eye.
Granted powers: Burning hands 1long rest. Augury 1day.
Allowed alignments: Any
Followers of Ineas, like their dietress, seek knowledge. Priests of Ineas are often sough as advisors and seers.
Dogma
We stand in the mists of time and thought. They bring to us whispers of what the world is, of its secrets, of its mysteries. Within the gray, we seek to know. Knowledge is like the mist, ephemeral and shapeless. We must gather it to us and record it for those will come after, those who tred in our footsteps, those who bring their neverending questions.
Avatar
Ineas appears as a wizened woman with flowing hair of silver white. Her skin is like parchment, weathered and ancient. Yet, she stands tall and straight as a younger woman. Most remarkable about her are her glittering eyes of brown and nimble hands. She cloaks herself in robes of gray surrounding with hovering motes of brillient power. She walks with a staff of white wood. Around its top are a ring of small silver stars that float in varying patterns, a gift from Atotz, her wife. She always carries great tomes with her if she wanders from her library.
Fellowship
The followers and clerics of Ineas tend to use magics to unearth secrets, such as spells of divination, knowledge, and charm. They typically use their spells only in this pursuit, gaining the disdain of others who would rather they use their divinity for people.
The paths of Ineas include the following:

Path of Dynasty: This path seeks the enlightenment and power of knowledge, secrets, and lore. Walkers of this path, or Lords, seek to know everything and anything. They are brokers of secrets of people, places, and things. Their knowledge and curiousity is vast as their libraries and memories. Many a king or noble lord has been aided and defeated by the Lords. The Lords rarely talk amongst each other, for fear of losing secrets to another; however, they do gather every few years in Arman to speak of what they have learned, sometimes to check for pieces they may not have.

Path of Adepts: This path seeks the ever changing power and mysteries of magic. Walkers of this path, or Magisters, are the divine counterparts to mages. The Magisters are adepts of herbs, alchemy, elements, rotes, rituals, and ancient lores yet found to create and expand the limits mages place on magic. When a Magister and a mage meet, the results can be catastrophic and illuminating for both. The Path of Adepts has strong roots in Dalpool, Pekar.

Path of Beasts: This path seeks to understand and become one with the bestial past of man and the creatures of the world. Walkers of this path, or the Savages, turn their backs on humanity and follow the instincts of survival and beasts. From the mundane to the exotic, these followers want to rejoin nature. However, due to their knowledge and lack of connection, they tend to lose their way, twisting man and creature into strange magical mixes. Some believe the Savages are responsible for the creation of aberrations, lycanthropy, and magical creatures that plague the countryside. The Savages have a loose organization, with strong roots to the Abysnis, Saalrand.

Path of Ash: This path seeks to understand the power and terror of the dead, undead, the afterlife, demons, and devils. Few walkers of the path, or the Burdens, ever successfully gain great knowledge of this path before dying terrible deaths. However, their knowledge is the greatest when one needs to understand the path of evil. Many nobles of Lumellan kingdoms have sought the Burdens when warring with each other. These followers hide themselves in the Ruins of Thrinacia of Caltorra.

Uztix - Goddess of Murder and Evil

Symbol: A coiled serpent around a skull.
Granted powers: Protection from goodevil 1long rest. Upon reaching appropriate level, confusion 1day.
Allowed alignment: Any evil.
Uztix ranks cheif among the evil deities of Malkoros. Whether out of loyalty or fear, all of the other dark powers bow to her authority. Worship of Uztix is both widespread and open in the Underdark; elsewhere, it is less common, and much more secretive.
The Dark Lady works through force and conquest wherever possible, but her true forte is in deceit and manipulation. She constantly looks to further her power by corrupting those who can be compromised.
Dogma
Ours is the path of power and rulership. Our dominion is the world. The keys of power are within our reach. Now is the time to take them! Any who wish to stand before us will fall. We will clease the world in our vision and rise from its ashes victorious.
Avatar
Uztix appears as a strikingly beautiful seductress with raven black hair and sapphire violet eyes. She is alluring and tempting, but hidden in the depths of her eyes is the maddening need to destroy and corrupt all in her path. Her appearance sometimes also reveals her true form of a serpent as she has the lower body of a naga, as well as snakelike eyes.
Fellowship
Clerics and followers of Uztix tend to follow dark and terrible paths of power. They seek to control all people, all lands. And if they must destroy them first only to rebuild, they will. These corruptors learn dark arts of destruction as well as rites and rituals of knowledge.
The fellowships of Uztix include the following:

Riders of the Dark Tide: The Riders are a terrible force of darkness and terror. They gather the minions of the dead and demonic to their banner to war against the warriors of light. Many in this legion become unholy powers, including vampires, shades, and death lords. They are known for their undead mounts with eyes of purple flame. Only the most powerful and unbalanced of her legions enter this path, for it chains their souls to the Dark Enchantress.

Oracles of Oblivion: The Oracles watch the cosmos and the hearts of people for a chance to corrupt. With darkened visions and magics, they delve deeply into the world to find its hidden truths to taint and twist for their own means. And once they have delivered their seed, they lie in wait and help it grow. Many of Uztix's followers take to this path.

Walkers of the Serpentine Labyrinth: The Walkers build and rebuild the world and mythos around them in an attempt to lose all peoples in their webs. The minds and machinations of these followers are considered mad, but only because Uztix herself is the only true seer of their logic. Uztix began this sect to hide her plots and desires from the rest of the world. Over the ages, the small sect has gained other followers. Some in Uztix's church believe that the web connects all of her followers through their dark dreams and desires, but only the Walkers know the truth. New Walkers are rare indeed for this web, as they are selected only by Uztix herself.
