# Attendants of the Rapture
**Fellowship of Othys, God of Death**

## Overview
The Attendants of the Rapture are the most numerous and widely known path among those who worship Othys, the Devourer and Walker of Shadows. Far from being grim reapers or harbingers of doom, they are gentle guides whose sacred duty is to bring comfort at death’s threshold and soothe the passage from life to death.

## Philosophy & Teachings
Attendants view death as a vital part of existence—a loving release rather than a frightful end. They teach that to join with Othys is to achieve ultimate peace and balance in the afterlife. The end of life is not to be feared but embraced as a return to the land of shade and rest under Othys’s watchful care.

Followers encourage acceptance, offering hope and solace rather than dread. Their sermons focus on tranquility, closure, and ascension—death as part of an eternal cycle.

## Rituals & Duties

- **Funeral Rites:** Attendants are renowned for their compassionate burial ceremonies. They prepare bodies with great respect, perform blessings for both soul and kin, and gently usher spirits toward Othys’s realm.
- **Hospice Care:** Many serve as caretakers in hospices or at deathbeds, comforting dying individuals regardless of faith or status.
- **Mediation:** Called upon by other faiths or families to resolve disputes over last wishes or inheritance with empathy.
- **Symbols & Temples:** Their temples are serene spaces filled with symbols representing peace—white lilies, quiet streams, soft candlelight—all intended to soothe mourners.

## Reputation & Reach
While some see their work as morbid or unsettling due to their association with death magic, many communities recognize their importance. Attendants are respected (if sometimes kept at arm's length) among humans and elves; fewer numbers can be found among dwarves and gnomes due to cultural differences regarding death rites.

## Roleplaying Hooks

- An Attendant may accompany adventurers on dangerous missions as an impartial guide for souls should tragedy strike.
- They might be sought out when a lingering spirit disturbs a village, performing rites only they know.
- Some may secretly harbor knowledge about undeath but refuse its practice except in dire need—to keep souls from torment rather than wield power.

## Symbolism  
Common symbols include peaceful skull motifs wreathed in flowers or resting on pillows; incense; water bowls reflecting candlelight; white sashes trimmed with midnight blue.
