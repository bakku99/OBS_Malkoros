# Attendants of the Rapture  
**Fellowship of Othys, God of Death**

## Overview
The Attendants of the Rapture are the most numerous and widely known path among those who worship Othys, the Devourer and Walker of Shadows. Far from being grim reapers or harbingers of doom, they are gentle guides whose sacred duty is to bring comfort at death’s threshold and soothe the passage from life to death. Their temples are places not only of mourning but also solace, acceptance, and gentle celebration of a life completed.

## Philosophy & Beliefs
Attendants believe death is not an end but a passage—a gentle transition to Othys’s land of shade and rest. They teach that all souls deserve peace in their final moments. The embrace of Othys is considered sweet, kind, and inevitable; resisting it brings only pain. The ultimate goal is to achieve balance by accepting mortality as a necessary part of existence. Life should be cherished, but so too should its natural conclusion.

Attendants do not seek to hasten death nor do they fear it. Instead, they prepare others—spiritually and emotionally—for their journey beyond. They perform last rites, ease suffering with prayer or magic, and provide support for grieving families.

## Practices & Rituals

- **Comforting Presence:** Attendants are trained in compassion and empathy; they serve in hospices, homes for the dying, or on battlefields—wherever souls stand at death’s door.
- **Last Rites:** They perform elaborate ceremonies guiding souls into Othys’s embrace with hymns, incense smoke (symbolizing the soul rising), and black-green ribbons.
- **Funeral Care:** They tend bodies with respect: washing them in midnight-scented oils and wrapping them in deep green cloths adorned with skull motifs.
- **Memorial Feasts:** After funerals, communities gather under an attendant’s guidance to share stories—celebrating what was beautiful about each life.
- **Dream Vigils:** Some employ necromantic spells not to raise undead but to gently commune with recently departed spirits—offering closure or final words for loved ones.

## Symbols & Vestments

- **Symbol:** A grinning skull surrounded by a halo or garland.
- **Colors:** Midnight black trimmed in deep green; often worn as robes with silver skull brooches.
- **Sacred Objects:** Vials containing “Tears of Solanis”—a rare substance said to ease passage into death’s realm when placed on a dying person’s lips.

## Hierarchy & Organization
The fellowship is loosely organized:
- **Mourners** (novices): Tend gravesites and assist during rites.
- **Guides** (priests/priestesses): Offer spiritual counseling; lead ceremonies.
- **Shepherds** (high priests): Oversee temples; train new Attendants; sometimes accompany kings or nobles as personal guides at court.

All are expected to embody patience, kindness, humility—and above all—the unwavering certainty that every soul must eventually rest.

## Reputation & Relations

Attendants are respected in many lands for their kindness but regarded warily by those who fear necromancy or misunderstand Othys's nature. Even followers of other faiths may seek their services when facing great loss or preparing for difficult farewells.

They rarely take sides in political struggles except where mercy or peace may be preserved. In times of plague or war they will risk much—even their own lives—to ensure no one dies alone or afraid.
