# Burning Sons

**Devoted warriors and monks who burn away impurity through sacred flame. They practice immolation rituals and view pain as the passage to transcendence. Often seen leading purging missions against planar invaders or corruption.**

---

## Overview

The Burning Sons are an ascetic martial order dedicated to Pyrius, the Eternal Flame. Founded in the smoldering heart of the Plane of Fire, their monasteries are built atop rivers of magma and within ever-burning calderas. The order sees fire not only as a weapon against evil but as an essential force for inner transformation.

### Motto
**“Through fire, all things become true.”**

---

## Tenets

1. **Pain is Purification:** Endure pain without flinching; let it burn away weakness and illusion.
2. **Flame Over Flesh:** Trust in Pyrius’s fire to shield you—eschew heavy armor and fear no heat.
3. **Burn Away Corruption:** Root out evil and stagnation wherever they take hold; cleanse with sacred flame.
4. **Embrace Renewal:** Destroy only that which resists change; nurture what emerges from the ashes.

## Practices & Rituals

- **Rite of Immolation:** Initiates meditate within controlled flames, emerging scarred but sanctified.
- **Ashen Vow:** Before battle, warriors coat themselves in sacred ash, symbolizing rebirth through destruction.
- **Sunwalk:** Senior monks walk barefoot across molten lava flows at dawn to demonstrate purity of purpose.

## Structure

- **Pyrophants** (Grandmasters): Lead entire monasteries; can call forth elemental fire at will.
- **Ablators** (Masters): Train new initiates and lead warbands on purging missions.
- **Sparks** (Initiates): Undergo constant tests of endurance and spirit; serve as scouts or messengers.

## Mechanical Benefits (for PCs)

*Note: These are suggestions for DMs/players to adapt.*

- All Burning Sons gain resistance or immunity to fire damage (as appropriate for level).
- Once per long rest, may cast *Burning Hands* or *Flame Blade* without material components.
- May use their action to ignite themselves in harmless flame for 1 minute (shedding bright light), gaining advantage on checks against fear or charm while alight.

## Adventure Hooks

2. A rogue Ablator seeks an artifact rumored to “burn even souls,” risking unleashing a planar conflagration.
3. The Sunwalk ritual is interrupted by frost giants invading from the Plane of Ice.

*To follow their path is to know that every scar can become a badge—and every wound a lesson written in ash.*
