# **Bladed Veil**

*The mask is never removed; the dagger is never seen. Every stage is a battlefield, every whisper a weapon.*

The Bladed Veil are Xexas’s most glamorous and feared followers: assassins who move unseen through the courts of Malkoros by dazzling their victims with art, wit, and beauty. Their performances are legendary — but so are the whispered rumors of rulers who did not live to see the curtain fall.

### **Initiation & Rites**
Before joining the Veil, initiates must stage a public performance so captivating that it draws tears from at least one noble. Unbeknownst to all present, during this same night they must also deliver a killing blow — often with nothing more than a poisoned kiss or slip of silk garrote. Only when both acts are complete do they receive their mask: porcelain on one side (for beauty), iron on the other (for death).

**Notable Rite:**  
*The Crimson Waltz* — A ceremonial dance performed at dawn after an assassination. The killer dances alone in blood-spattered silks beneath moonlight, reciting verses about beauty and death. The corpse remains their silent partner until sunrise.

### **Hierarchy**
- **The Masque** – The enigmatic leader; identity ever-changing.
- **Lead Players** – Masters of particular arts (song, dance, knifeplay).
- **Chorus** – Journeyman assassins.
- **Petals** – New initiates.

### **Mottoes**
- “All eyes on us; all knives in them.”
- “A blade needs no sheath if it wears a smile.”

### **Adventure Hooks**
1. **A Masked Invitation:**  
  The PCs are invited to a royal gala starring famed performers rumored to be Bladed Veil. When nobles begin dying mysteriously mid-party (each death reflecting some element of that night’s play), can they unmask the killers before they themselves become part of the final act?

2. **Betrayer’s Apprentice:**  
  A young artist begs for protection from masked assassins after refusing initiation into the Veil — but soon it’s revealed she possesses secret knowledge about Nythara or Xexas himself.

3. **Silken Shadows:**  
  A rival guild seeks aid against encroaching Bladed Veil agents who have infiltrated every level of city society: courtesans in brothels, actors in street theaters… even children singing rhymes laced with coded messages.

### **Relics & Treasures**
- *Veiled Dagger*: Appears as an innocent hairpin or fan but springs forth as a poisoned blade when needed.
- *Mask of Perfumed Lies*: Allows wearer to cast Disguise Self at will; advantage on Deception checks while worn.
- *Crimson Requiem*: A sheet of music — when played and sung during an assassination attempt, confers magical silence around its performer.
