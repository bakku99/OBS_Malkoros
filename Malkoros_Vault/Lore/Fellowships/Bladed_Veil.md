# Bladed Veil

*The mask is never removed; the dagger is never seen. Every stage is a battlefield, every whisper a weapon.*

The Bladed Veil are the most notorious of Xexas’s fellowships: a secretive order of assassins who hide in plain sight as performers, courtesans, and artists. To the unknowing, they are the heart of any royal celebration — dazzling dancers, captivating actors, intimate confidantes. But behind their painted faces and practiced smiles lies the deadliest steel.

## Origins & Structure

Founded in the aftermath of Sangelline’s fall, when trust was slaughtered and beauty became a weapon, the Bladed Veil perfected their art among ruined courts. Their hierarchy is fluid; all members wear masks (literal or figurative), known to each other only by code-names drawn from flowers or tragic lovers. The highest echelons are called **The Petals**, directing contracts and keeping secrets within secrets.

## Beliefs & Rituals

To be beautiful is to be dangerous.
To love is to destroy.
Every performance must draw blood — whether from heart or vein.

Initiates undergo the "Sighing Rite": a masked ball where poison-laced wine flows freely; only those who resist temptation — or survive it — are welcomed into the fold.

**Sacred tools:** Silk scarves sewn with razors; perfume that kills with a breath; stage props that double as deadly weapons.

## Activities

- **Assassination by Art:** Many victims die not realizing they were targeted until their final breath. A poisoned kiss during an opera curtain call; a dagger slipped between ribs during an embrace.
- **Espionage:** Secrets gathered in pillow talk or backstage whispers are sold for fortunes — or delivered as leverage for Xexas’s schemes.
- **Cultural Subversion:** The Veil manipulates public opinion through plays and scandals, using art as both smokescreen and scalpel.

## Roleplaying Hooks

- Are you there to entertain…or to kill?
- What mask do you wear when no one watches?
- Can you truly love someone you might be ordered to destroy?

## Symbolism

Members mark themselves discreetly: a single drop-shaped tattoo near their lips, signifying both poison and tears. Their signature flower arrangement at events always includes one bleeding rose.
