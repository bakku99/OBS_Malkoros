# Children of Shard-Flesh


Demonic savants who sew different pieces of Ulvaarak’s will into flesh, creating warped “prophets” of madness. They do not speak — their bodies pulse with ritual screams encoded in muscle.

# Children of Shard-Flesh

**Fellowship of Ulvaarak – Demonic Savants, Weavers of Living Blasphemy**

**Symbol:** A flayed face stitched over a screaming jaw, with sinews stretched into the shape of an open eye.

## Overview
The Children of Shard-Flesh are not a cult in the mortal sense, but a grotesque lineage of demon-flesh sculptors and living blasphemies. Where others worship Ulvaarak through violence or hunger, these mad artisans channel his will by fusing flesh, bone, and spirit into new forms. They believe that every scar is a sigil, every mutation a syllable in the unending howl that is Ulvaarak’s will.

## Doctrine and Beliefs
- **Speech Is a Lie:** The Children do not speak in words. Instead, their bodies become living texts—muscles twitch in forbidden patterns, skin pulses with silent screams only the insane can hear.
- **The Flesh Is a Canvas:** Ritual mutilation and surgical fusion are acts of praise. Each grafted limb or extra jaw is believed to hold a fragment—a “shard”—of Ulvaarak’s mind.
- **Prophets by Assembly:** The highest among them are “Prophets Assembled,” patchwork horrors stitched together from many demons or even mortals. These beings channel visions and madness directly from the Maw.

## Practices
- **Ritual Grafting:** Initiates undergo agonizing rites where pieces of abyssal creatures or slain enemies are sewn into their own bodies. Acceptance (survival) means being reborn as part-message, part-messenger.
- **Silent Processions:** In battle or ritual, Children march silently—save for the wet slapping of flesh—communicating through synchronized spasms and muscle-ripples carrying coded messages.
- **Creation of Living Tomes:** Some Children craft “flesh-tomes”—living creatures whose bodies bear runes made from scars and brands. Reading these tomes causes hallucinations or instant madness.

## Role in Demon Society
Feared even among other demons, the Children serve as prophets (and sometimes executioners) to demon lords seeking omens from Ulvaarak. Their presence heralds outbreaks of mutation and insanity wherever they pass.

## Notable Ranks
- **Carvers:** Initiates and surgeons who perform flesh-grafting rites.
- **Assemblers:** Mid-ranked flesh-crafters skilled at creating composite demons.
- **Prophets Assembled:** Massive conglomerations—sometimes dozens fused into one—that thrash with visions no single mind could endure.

## Gifts/Boons
Members may:
- Communicate silently across great distances via muscle-scream code.
- Once per long rest: Ignore spell effects that target their minds (as their consciousness is too fractured to interpret meaning).
- Can fuse with another willing demon temporarily to share senses/memories (at risk of mutual madness).
