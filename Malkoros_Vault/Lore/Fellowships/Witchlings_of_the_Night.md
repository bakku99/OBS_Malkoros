# Witchlings of the Night


The Witchlings are a group that the followers of Hostus wish they could forget. When Hostus tasted Othys's tongue and blood, a dark seed of anger and treachery blossomed in the lord of nature. When he spat forth that tongue and seed into the earth, fires erupted and birthed a child of dark nature. This child gathered followers of Othys, who believe nature is dangerous, beautiful, and deadly. To this day, this small and secretive sect works to destroy all creations of civilization, and then replace them with their ideal of nature.
