# Governors of Battle


The Governors are tacticians of battle. These warriors begin as scribes and work their way up through a rigorous knighthood to become members. Their studies not only include warfare but the best routes for supplies, keeping wars from overwhelming the populace, the best use of numbers against various odds, and the political meanderings of treaties. They are a holy order seeking to balance honor and dignity with warfare and safety. Although these warriors adhere to a stringent set of rules, they rarely allow the prestige to go to their head. Governors are found among the human nations.
