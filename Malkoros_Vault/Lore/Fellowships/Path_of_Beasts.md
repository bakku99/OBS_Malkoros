# Path of Beasts


This path seeks to understand and become one with the bestial past of man and the creatures of the world. Walkers of this path, or the Savages, turn their backs on humanity and follow the instincts of survival and beasts. From the mundane to the exotic, these followers want to rejoin nature. However, due to their knowledge and lack of connection, they tend to lose their way, twisting man and creature into strange magical mixes. Some believe the Savages are responsible for the creation of aberrations, lycanthropy, and magical creatures that plague the countryside. The Savages have a loose organization, with strong roots to the Abysnis, Saalrand.
