# Ashen Circle

*The wise hand that tempers the flame of vengeance.*

## Origins and Purpose

Founded in the smoldering aftermath of the Ashen Rebellion, the Ashen Circle emerged not as a militant order, but as a council of conscience. Its earliest members were judges who had once enforced Obrenic law, rebels haunted by their own brutalities, and scholars who saw justice twisted by zealotry. United by doubts and scars alike, they gathered in secret to ask: when does righteous wrath become tyranny reborn?

The Circle believes that Vaelrethâ€™s final oath was not only a call to punish evil, but a warning against becoming what one fights. They teach that every act of vengeance carries seeds of future injustice unless guided by wisdom and restraint.
