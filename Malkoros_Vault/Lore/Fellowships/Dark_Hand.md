# Dark Hand


Members of the Dark Hand take a dark road of death, delivering its chill touch to those they deem worthy. These are the judges, the dividers of the way. Their methods are questionable and bent, gaining the fear and loathing of most of the pantheon and people of Malkoros. Their techniques include torture, deprevation, and bloodletting. And those that receive their dark gift are those who meet the sometimes twisted, other times coldly calculating, sense of worth. The numbers of this path grow and dwindle without any clear reason. They are found typically around the human nations, the various mines of Dramfark, and the Underdark nations.

### The Dark Hand Fellowship

Shrouded in secrets as deep as the starless chasms beneath ancient Veyrn, the Dark Hand is less a mere cabal than a living shadow—its will an echo of Othys’ own hunger. Born in the aftermath of the Obsidian Sundering, when trust splintered among mortals and gods alike, the fellowship began as a whispered pact between outcast seers and broken knights who had peered too long into forbidden wells. They did not gather seeking power alone; they gathered to survive what they had seen.

**Structure and Practices:**  
The Dark Hand eschews hierarchy for layers of veiled trust. Its members know each other only by mask and sign—never by name. Initiation requires three nights wandering blindfolded through the black tunnels beneath Tharion’s Ruins, guided only by distant songs composed of Othysian riddles. Those who emerge changed—marked with a scar that never heals—are welcomed as kin.

Meetings are rare but meticulously orchestrated: silent circles held under new moons, where each member offers a secret to Othys before plans are spoken aloud. Their rituals are acts of memory unmaking: burning pages from their own lives, cutting away old alliances until nothing remains but devotion to purpose.

**Purpose:**  
Contrary to rumor, the Dark Hand is no simple assassin’s guild or thieves’ circle. Their true charge is to dismantle certainty itself—to sow doubt within empires and faiths grown fat on complacency. They believe that truth must be broken so it can be reforged into something more resilient; that hope must die before it can be born anew.

To this end, they have toppled prophets with rumors alone; turned lovers against kings with carefully placed lies; unmade sacred relics not through theft but through revelation of their mundane origins. Every act is a prayer to Othys—the Unmaking Eye—calling forth entropy in service to ultimate renewal.

**Symbolism:**  
Members wear blackened rings set with shards of smoked glass—a reminder that even vision itself is fragmented in Othys’ gaze. Their sigil appears upon ancient doors and forbidden tomes: an open hand wreathed in swirling mist, fingers dissolving at the edges.

**Influence:**  
The reach of the Dark Hand is felt wherever order festers unchecked or when secrets threaten to calcify into tyranny. In whispered tales told by trembling elders, it was they who ended the Nightward Regency; others say their influence yet festers at court, ever patient for rot to bloom anew.

To truly understand them one must face what they worship: not destruction for its own sake but necessary dissolution—a clearing away so that something truer might rise from ruin.
