# Accorded Eyes

**Fellowship of Azhadûn:**  
*Infernal scribes, both mortal and fiendish, who draft contracts, wills, and magical bindings. Their quills are dipped in soul-ink, and their work is said to last even beyond death.*

---

## Purpose

The Accorded Eyes are the bureaucrats of damnation. They believe that every soul’s fate is etched not in prophecy or violence, but in writing — carefully worded and eternally binding. Their duty is to ensure that no pact is ever broken, no clause overlooked, and that every promise made under Azhadûn’s watchful gaze is enforced across all planes.

## Structure

- **Grand Scriptor:** The supreme scribe who oversees the archives of Hell; always a powerful devil or ascended mortal whose memory is flawless.
- **Archivists:** Senior members entrusted with drafting major infernal contracts (such as those binding nations or archfiends).
- **Quillbearers:** Lesser devils or mortals who handle routine agreements — property swaps, indentures of service, wills securing souls for the afterlife.
- **Inkseekers:** Apprentices tasked with gathering rare inks (often distilled from souls), parchment from demon-hide, and forbidden tomes.

## Rites & Traditions

- **Oathbinding Ceremony:** Every new member must inscribe their true name in a living ledger; erasure means oblivion.
- **The Red Quill Vigil:** During infernal eclipses, Accorded Eyes fast and copy ancient contracts by candlelight to renew their power.
- **Soul-Inking:** The process of sealing truly unbreakable pacts using ink made from condemned spirits — a closely guarded secret.

## Symbolism & Attire

Members wear crimson robes with chain motifs. Each carries an infernal quill: black for mortals in training; silver for full scribes; gold for archivists; and blood-red for the Grand Scriptor. All bear signet rings shaped like a crowned eye over a scroll.

## Powers & Boons

- Can cast *Comprehend Languages* at will while reading or drafting contracts.
- Once per long rest: Invoke *Zone of Truth* (DC 16) when witnessing agreements.
- Trained members may attempt to magically “seal” oaths: any creature willingly signing an Accorded Eyes pact suffers dire consequences (as per *Geas*, DM's discretion) if they break it.

## Notable Members
