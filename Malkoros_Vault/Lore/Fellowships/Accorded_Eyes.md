# Accorded Eyes

**Fellowship of Azhadûn:**  
*Infernal scribes, both mortal and fiendish, who draft contracts, wills, and magical bindings. Their quills are dipped in soul-ink, and their work is said to last even beyond death.*

---

## Purpose

The Accorded Eyes are the bureaucrats of damnation. They believe that every soul’s fate is etched not in prophecy or violence, but in writing — carefully worded and eternally binding. Their duty is to ensure that no pact is ever broken, no clause overlooked, and that every promise made under Azhadûn’s watchful gaze is enforced across all planes.

**Role:** Infernal Scribes, Contract-Masters, Bureaucrats of Damnation  
**Symbol:** An inkpot of molten gold, with a quill shaped like a chain-link feather and a single unblinking eye.

### Doctrine & Purpose
The Accorded Eyes serve as the keepers and crafters of all infernal contracts under Azhadûn. They believe words — not swords — are the true instruments of power. Every oath, pact, soul-bargain, and infernal codex is drafted or reviewed by their careful hands. Their guiding creed: *“Every promise is a prison; every signature is a shackle.”*

- **Unbreakable Wording:** Their contracts are legendary for their airtight clauses and subtle traps. Even gods hesitate to challenge an Accorded contract.
- **Soul-Ink:** They write with quills dipped in distilled spirit essence, ensuring their work binds on both mortal parchment and the fabric of souls.
- **Eternal Archives:** In Hell’s deepest vaults lie endless stacks of contracts — some so old that even devils tremble to invoke them.

### Ranks & Structure
1. **Initiates of Ink** – Novices who transcribe minor pacts under supervision.
2. **Redactors** – Scribes trusted with amending or interpreting ancient contracts.
3. **Binders** – Senior members empowered to draft original soul-bargains or magical geasa.
4. **Eyes Proper** – The innermost circle; only they may witness the signing of world-altering pacts.

### Powers & Boons
- **Read Contract (Su):** Once per day, an Accorded Eye can instantly understand any written agreement’s true meaning, including hidden clauses or magical bindings.
- **Seal of Irrevocability (Sp):** At higher ranks, they can magically enforce any contract signed in their presence (as *geas/quest* or *binding*).
- **Never Forget (Ex):** Members have perfect recall for any written word they have ever seen.

### Mortal Worshippers & Cults
Ambitious lawyers, wizard-notaries, and corrupt judges may secretly venerate the Accorded Eyes — seeking boons for legal victories or unbreakable deals.
