## Backstory
 "Erci Tinkerton wasn't your average rock gnome. Sure, he loved burrowing through mountain tunnels and tinkering with gears and sprockets. But the hum of the human world below kept calling, a discordant symphony compared to the gnomes' rhythmic clanging. One starry night, Erci left his cavern home, a sack of tools on his back and a wild gleam in his beard. He craved inspiration, something beyond the predictable click-clack of gnome contraptions.

Erci's wanderings led him to a bustling human town, where his short stature and pointy hat garnered curious stares. But Erci, never one for self-consciousness, charmed his way into a blacksmith's forge, offering his gnome's knack for fine mechanics in exchange for hearth and hammers. It was there, amidst the roar of flames and clang of metal, that Erci found a new muse. He saw ingenuity in the humans' simple tools, poetry in the way their homes fit the curves of the landscape. Every creak and groan whispered secrets of invention.

But Erci wasn't alone in his pursuit of innovation. Tucket, a plump brown rat with an air of scholarly disdain, shared his cot. No ordinary rodent, Tucket was once a powerful wizard, victim of a botched spell that shrunk him and stripped his magic. Though trapped in a furry form, Tucket's mind remained sharp. He regaled Erci with tales of arcane lore, his raspy squeaks weaving spells of knowledge about imbuing objects with magical properties.

Erci, a quick learner with grease-stained fingers and a tinkerer's spark in his eyes, absorbed Tucket's wisdom like a sponge. He began crafting not just tools, but enchanted contraptions. A hammer that pulsed with earth magic, a lantern that whispered secrets of the wind, a clock that ticked with the rhythm of the stars, each imbued with a touch of Tucket's former sorcery.

News of Erci's wondrous inventions spread like wildfire. Gnome and human alike sought his curious creations. But for Erci, the real reward was the journey, the thrill of discovery, the whispered guidance of his furry familiar. He walked the line between human and gnome, a bridge between ingenuity and magic, forging a path where gears met spells and ideas took flight on tiny, leathery wings."
