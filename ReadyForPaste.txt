##Heading 1
Balance

The content of this book is something I’ve worked on extensively to make as balanced as possible, but I think it’s worth talking here in this foreword about what that means, why it might or might not matter, and what to do if your experiences differ.

The point of balance in a cooperative game is twofold. First, so that the GM can run the game within the parameters of the base content without having to tailor and rebalance the experience. Second, so that players can feel free to make the choices they want to make about their character without feeling they are placing themselves at a disadvantage.

The content in this book is different from the default content of the game, but a great deal of care and testing has gone into making sure that it can play alongside the default content. Everything between these covers has been used in games, and reviewed by many eyes... but that guarantees little.

Content can be used in many ways. Expectations can differ. Rolled stats, crazy luck, creative uses, and clever combinations of abilities can always result in varied experiences... particularly when there are as many options as are presented here.

My intention with this book is that the content will feel at home among the default options of the base game and its first expansion. That is what I use in my game in addition to my own content, and that’s what I’ve compared the options presented here to throughout the process of creating it.

##Box
Bakku's Note for GM's
When using character options, creativity is encouraged; not only is creativity in the title, but everything contained has many options. This book holds a vast amount of options that can be arranged and rearranged.

But you are not playing against your GM. At the end of the day, the GM has the final say on how any ability works, and what is an option. Your GM has allowed this book, and ultimately anything in it is up to them to allow.

The way to have the most fun with these options is to work collaboratively with what you want to do with your GM on the character you want to make, and how the presented options here will play into that.

The more consideration you put into making sure that your character will fit with the GM’s expectations, the more you can count on them feeling good about allowing you to use the full breadth and depth of content—not just this book, but the wide expanse of options out there. The more they have to double check and vet everything to ensure that all the players have fun at the table, the less they will be able to allow it to be used in the game—quite possibly even content that would otherwise be perfectly balanced.

Balance is a collaboration between players and their GM. Look for combinations that are cool. Look for ways to use the rules that are fun. Even look for ways to make your character feel powerful and strong! But if you think you see something that would make your character broken, talk to your GM. You’re going to need to rely on them to allow it anyway, and both of you are going to be happier knowing if it will be allowed before you decide to play it.

##Box
Bakku's Note for Players
At the end of the day, you have all the power when it comes to balancing the game. I’ve attempted to make this content as easy to allow as possible, but if you find something that doesn’t fit in your game, you know your game better than I do.

I would offer some things to consider, the foremost of which is that 5e is not a perfectly balanced game. I have put in a great deal of effort to make sure that nothing contained in the book eclipses the default options, but at the same time, the default options are a very wide spectrum of content in terms of balance.

If you find an option that seems like it is too much, it might be that you need to adjust it, but it also might be a confluence of events that will solve themselves. If a player is doing more damage than other members of the party, will they still be in a few levels? Have they invested more heavily in doing damage?

Certain kinds of druids find great power early in the game. Certain feats allow for a lot of power. This is in no way a suggestion that nothing should be changed (I change many things within my own game) just a reminder to consider everything in context and the potential ramifications down the road of making changes.

##Heading 2
Crafting and Balance

One of the biggest considerations for balance exists not in the player options at all, but in the crafting options. While the crafting system aims to fairly tightly replicate the traditional rate of acquisition using the presented rules, it is undeniable that the synergy between character options (both default options and ones presented here) and magic items that the players can select exists.

The magic items and their present recipes are presented as tools to make playing the game more fun. It is a tool for both the player and GM, but like any tool, consideration should be placed into how it is used.

Not all magic items exist in all settings. The rules present as wide a selection as possible to lower the burden on the GM, but they always have the ability to define which items can or cannot be made (or need to be tweaked) on a case by case basis.

##Heading 2
Closing Thoughts
I do not run everything in this book as written every time. I run what works for my game. I have written things in this book in my attempt to capture an experience as close as possible to the default assumptions of the game, but those are nothing more or less than assumptions—a best fit line for as many games as possible.

As much as possible feel free to stand on these rules and build on them as a foundation, but never let what is written here be a shackle. My only goal in writing this book was to provide a set of tools that will be useful to you in running a game that you and your player enjoy. If any part of these rules contradict that goal for you, purge them with fire.

Lastly, there is a large community of folks that use this content in some degree. While they cannot be found in the pages of this book, feel free to reach out and seek opinions, thoughts, and help with anything presented within!



##Heading 1
INVENTOR

##Body text
A gnome sits hunched over a workbench in a room cluttered with every sort of tool, carefully drawing the final lines to an intricate rune. With a crackling hum of arcane energy, the completed rune flares with power, and she watches with a smile of pride as the golem comes to life and stands.

##Body text
An ogre looms large over a dwarf, saliva sloping down its chin as it considers its hearty meal. Its growling anticipation turns into horrified roars of agony as the dwarf unloads terrifying blasts of thunderous power from a small, metal tube.

##Body text
With a mighty bloom and a crackle of energy, a lone figure lands in the middle of the battlefield. As the smoke clears, a towering presence stands amidst the war-torn ruins clad in glowing, mechanical plate. The luminous visor swivels to inspect the wreckage. It raises a gauntlet, and lightning surges forth.

##Body text
With a beckoning gesture, the elf summons a swirl of swords leaping from their sheaths and springing to life. The shocked bandits begin to edge away, breaking into a run as the swords exuberantly give chase.

##Body text
Makers of magic-infused objects, inventors are defined by their innovative nature. Like wizards, they see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled through a combination of thorough study and investigation. Inventors, though, focus on creating marvelous, new magical objects. Spells are often too ephemeral and temporary for their tastes. Instead, they seek to craft durable, useful items.

##Heading 2
CUNNING CREATORS

##Body text
Every inventor is defined by a specific craft. Inventors see mastering the basics of a craft as the first step towards true progress, the invention of new methods, and innovative approaches. Inventors are arcane engineers, students of invention and warfare who craft deadly firearms, ingenious gadgets, magical armor, and mechanical beings that they can augment with magic.

##Body text
All inventors are united by their curious and creative nature. To an inventor, magic is an evolving art with a leading edge of discovery and mastery that pushes further ahead with each passing year.

##Body text
Inventors value novelty and innovation. This penchant pushes them to seek a life of adventure.

##Body text
A hidden ruin might hold a forgotten magic item or a beautifully crafted mirror perfect for magical enhancement. Inventors win respect and renown among their kind by uncovering new lore or inventing new methods of creation.

##Heading 2
BOUNDLESS IMAGINATION

##Body text
An inventor is not the sort to be limited by what already exists or by conventional wisdom. They combine all the tools at their disposal to go beyond—to discover new boundaries and promptly exceed them. Few things can stand in the path of an inventor with a mind to change the world.

##Body text
Seeking to push beyond all and striving for the new is the unifying call of inventors, but how jealously they guard their secrets can vary greatly. Some push their knowledge upon the worlds, while others hoard it.

##Heading 2
RIVALS AND CHALLENGES

##Body text
Inventors often acquire rivals—other inventors racing to be the first to unlock the secrets of the world, scrambling to be the one after whom a new magical theory or scientific breakthrough will forever be named. Theft and acquisition of stolen ideas can often become an issue when too many inventors clash over a field of expertise.

##Body text
Further, inventors quickly make enemies of those who would just as soon see the world unchanged.

##Body text
They are often viewed as dangerous upstarts or radical troublemakers with their newfangled ways of doing things.

##Body text
These challenges rarely daunt an inventor for long and most often simply fuel their continued drive to rise above. Inventors are rarely set in their ways, and the hated rival of last week may be a research associate the next.

##Heading 2
CREATING AN INVENTOR

##Body text
When creating an inventor character, think about your character’s background and drive for adventure. Does the character have a rival? What drove your character down the path of becoming an inventor? Is it about curiosity and innovation, or is it about the power their inventions bring? Did your character learn from another inventor, or did they receive a vision or flash of inspiration to learn their craft?

##Body text

##Heading 2
QUICK BUILD

##Body text
You can make an inventor quickly by following these suggestions. For the Gadgetsmith, Thundersmith, Cursesmith, or Relicsmith specializations, make your highest ability score Dexterity, followed by Intelligence; for the Golemsmith, Infusionsmith, Potionsmith, or Runesmith specializations, make Intelligence your highest, followed by Constitution or Dexterity; and for Warsmith or Fleshsmith specializations, choose either Strength or Intelligence as your highest, with Constitution as your second-highest ability score. Second, choose a background that emphasizes your connection to a guild or society.

##Heading 2
INVENTOR SPECIALIZATION

##Body text
At 1st level, you focus your craft on a particular specialization: Cursesmith, Fleshsmith, Gadgetsmith, Golemsmith, Infusionsmith, Potionsmith, Relicsmith, Thundersmith, or Warsmith, each of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 5th, and 14th level.

##Heading 2
MAGIC ITEM ANALYSIS

##Body text
Starting at 1st level, your understanding of magic items allows you to analyze and understand their secrets. You know the detect magic and identify spells, and you can cast them as a ritual, requiring no material components.

##Heading 2
TOOL EXPERTISE

##Body text
Starting at 2nd level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses any of the tool proficiencies you gained from this class.

##Heading 2
ARCANE RETROFIT

##Body text
Additionally at 2nd level, you gain the ability to retrofit magical gear. During a long rest you can perform a ritual using any +1, +2, or +3 weapon—excluding artifacts and sentient weapons— to transfer the magic into an inventor weapon (a weapon created by a subclass feature or upgrade). For example, you can turn a +1 longsword and your Impact Gauntlet into a +1 Impact Gauntlet . This includes weapon-like Upgrades that make attack and damage rolls, such as a Warsmith’s Force Blast.

##Body text
You can’t transfer any properties from a magical weapon besides a bonus to attack and damage rolls, and the original weapon is destroyed in the process.

##Body text
Additionally, you can convert a set of armor with a magical bonus to AC to a lighter armor type.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Additional Retrofits

##Body text
At the GM’s option, this feature can be expanded to do similar tasks. For example, you may be allowed to turn a +1 heavy crossbow into a +1 light crossbow, or the GM may choose to allow this feature to work with other magical armor or weapons, such as converting adamantine chain mail into an adamantine chain shirt.

SPELLCASTING

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
At 2nd level, as part of your study of magic you gain the ability to cast spells. The spells you learn are limited in scope, primarily concerned with modifying creatures and objects or creating items.

##Body text
Spell Slots

##Body text
The Inventor table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your inventor spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

##Body text
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell longstrider and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast longstrider using either slot.

##Body text
Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

##Body text
You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the inventor spell list.

##Body text
The Spells Known column of the Inventor table shows when you learn more inventor spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
### Layout: end frame

##Body text
Inventor’s Spellcasting

##Body text
An inventor is fundamentally someone that understands and regularly interacts with magic, leading to the ability to apply this knowledge as a spellcaster, but how you want to approach your inventor’s spellcasting is up to you.

##Body text
Feel free to explore other approaches in coordination with your GM. From a functional standpoint, the only requirement is that you have a defined material component or focus for a spell that requires it.
##Body text
 Consider for some spells perhaps using your artisan’s tools as your focus, or perhaps a specific item you’ve made is your material component for a spell. Perhaps instead of a “component pouch” that simply contains all the material components you could need for your spells, you have an “inventor’s tool belt” that contains the various spellcasting assistance contraptions you’ve made to cast your spells. For mechanical purposes, the only thing that matters is that it functions in the same way and is used consistently.
### Layout: end frame

##Body text
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the inventor spells you know and replace it with another spell from the inventor spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##Body text
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

##Body text
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

##Body text
Spellcasting Focus

##Body text
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your inventor spells.

##Heading 2
SPECIALIZATION UPGRADE

##Body text
At 3rd level, choose an upgrade from the list at the end of your specialization, gaining the benefits listed in its description.

##Body text
You select an additional upgrade at 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, and 19th level. You can’t select an upgrade more than once, unless the upgrade’s description says otherwise. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can exchange one of your existing upgrades with another upgrade of the same level requirement as the replaced upgrade.

##Body text
Whenever an existing upgrade is exchanged for a replacement upgrade (either by a subclass feature or when you gain a level), the new upgrade is selected as if you’re the level you were when you originally gained that upgrade. For example, if you replace your Stormforged Weapon and reselect all of your upgrades as a 5th-level inventor, you could select one 3rd-level upgrade and one 5th-level upgrade, or two 3rd-level upgrades, but you would not be able to select two 5th-level upgrades.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Customizing Inventor Upgrades

##Body text
The upgrades for each Inventor Specialization are presented in a list at the end of the subclass, but invariably there will always be ideas for upgrades not included in that list. At the heart of an inventor beats an unrelenting drive for creativity, after all! Feel free to consult your GM for potential custom upgrades.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

### Layout: end frame

##Body text
The following generic upgrades are available to all subclasses, and can be selected in place of any subclass upgrade:

##Body text
Shield Proficiency Unrestricted Generic Upgrade 
##Body text
You gain proficiency with shields.

##Body text
Tool Proficiency Unrestricted Generic Upgrade 
##Body text
You gain proficiency with a tool of your choice.

##Heading 2
ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

##Body text
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##Heading 2
ARCANE RECONSTRUCTION

##Body text
At 6th level, you have mastered the knowledge of using magic to repair things. You learn the mending cantrip, and you can cast it at will. Additionally, you learn the cure wounds spell. If you already know cure wounds, you learn a different spell of your choice from the inventor spell list. Constructs targeted by your cure wounds can regain hit points as normal.

##Heading 2
CROSS-DISCIPLINARY KNOWLEDGE

##Body text
At 6th level, you can expand on your knowledge across fields. You can craft one of the following: any of the Gadgetsmith’s Unrestricted Upgrades, an Infusionsmith’s Animated Weapon, Blasting Rod, or Infused Weapon, a Potionsmith’s Alchemical Reagent Pouch and Alchemical Fire or Alchemical Acid, or a Thundersmith’s Stormforged Weapon.

##Body text
If you select a Stormforged Weapon, you gain proficiency with that weapon and knowledge of how to make ammunition for it (if required). You can’t apply Infused Weapon to another weapon granted by this class.

##Body text
If this crafted item is lost or destroyed, you can remake it following the rules for remaking it in its respective subclass.

##Heading 2
WONDROUS ITEM PROFICIENCY

##Body text
At 7th level, your familiarity with the workings of magical items means that you ignore all class requirements on the use of magic items. Additionally, you can now attune to up to four magic items at once.

##Heading 2
IMPROVED MAGICAL CRAFTING

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
At 10th level, your experience in creating your own wondrous inventions makes you more adept at crafting a magic item than normal spellcasters. Creating a non-consumable magic item takes you half the time it would normally take.

##Body text
Additionally, you can make 1 hour of progress toward crafting a magic item, potion, or scroll during a long rest.

##Heading 2
WONDROUS ITEM RECHARGE

##Body text
Starting at 10th level, you can recharge a magic item that has charges or per rest uses, as long as those charges or uses can only be used to cast spells. To restore charges or uses, you perform a ritual that takes 1 minute and expend a spell slot of a level equal to or greater than the spell slot level of a spell cast by the item.

Interaction with the Crafting System

##Body text
If you are using the Crafting System presented later in the book, this reduces the time a crafting check takes to 1 hour, allowing you to make two crafting checks during a long rest, or eight during a work day.
### Layout: end frame

##Body text
The number of charges or uses restored to the item is equal to the number of charges or uses required to cast that spell using the item once.

STUDY OF MAGIC

##Body text
At 11th level, your proficiency in the workings of magic has become so great you can cast the detect magic and identify spells at will without expending a spell slot.

##Body text
Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks made to understand the workings of magical traps, effects, or runes.

##Heading 2
WONDROUS ITEM MASTERY

##Body text
Starting at 18th level, you can use a magic item that would normally take an action as a bonus action instead. In addition, you can now attune to up to five magic items at once.

##Heading 2
PEERLESS INVENTOR

##Body text
At 20th level, your mind is always thinking of new options and clever solutions. At the end of a short or long rest, you can create a temporary version of an Upgrade from your subclass that you meet the prerequisites for but don’t already have. This upgrade must have a level requirement of 11th level or lower, and it lasts until you finish a short or long rest, at which time you can select a temporary Upgrade with this feature again.

Magical or Mechanical?

##Body text
One of the core debates that arises around inventors is if they are a “Magical Engineer” or what a magical engineer would even mean. Do they tinker with mechanics and gears or with magic and runes? The answer is, of course, whatever suits your world, game, and the vision of the player.

GADGETSMITH

##Body text
A gadgetsmith is an inventor whose curiosity and inventive genius have run rampant. While other inventors may spend their whole career perfecting a single-minded pursuit, a gadgetsmith believes that quantity is at least as good as quality.

##Body text
Quick footed and even quicker witted, gadgetsmiths are never caught without another trick up their sleeve—their minds always jumping ahead to solve the next problem with a clever contraption.

##Body text
A gadgetsmith can come from any walk of life, but they usually exemplify curiosity and a distaste for the suppression of knowledge or technology, usually favoring freedom to experiment and leaning toward more chaotic behaviors.

##Heading 2
GADGETSMITH’S PROFICIENCY

##Body text
When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with nets, rapiers, whips, and tinker’s tools.

##Heading 2
ESSENTIAL TOOLS

##Body text
At 1st level, you’ve mastered the creation of the essential reusable tools for surviving the battlefield as a gadgeteer. You have the following items:

##Bullet
 • Gadgetsmith Weapon. Choose one of the following from the Upgrade section: Impact Gauntlets, Lightning Baton, Repeating Hand Crossbow, Ricocheting Weapon, or Shock Generator. You gain the chosen upgrade, and it doesn’t count against your total number of upgrades.
##Bullet
 • Grappling Hook. You can forgo any attack you make as part of the Attack action to throw your grappling hook at a target within 20 feet of you. The target can be a creature, object, or surface. If the target is Small or smaller, make a grapple check against it, pulling it to you and grappling it on a success. If the target is Medium or larger, you can instead pull yourself to it (no check required); this doesn’t grapple the target. Opportunity attacks provoked by this movement are made with disadvantage.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

##Bullet
 • Smoke Bomb. As an action, you can use a smoke bomb to cast the fog cloud spell centered on yourself, without expending a spell slot and requiring no components. The spell lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier and doesn’t require your concentration. When you cast fog cloud in this way, you can choose for it to have a radius of 5, 10, 15, or 20 feet.

Unlimited Smoke Bombs?

##Body text
If you or your GM are concerned about the unlimited use of Smoke Bombs, consider limiting them to a number of uses per short rest equal to your proficiency bonus. This shouldn’t mechanically impact their usage, but the reason they don’t have a limit is to encourage players to feel free to use them in non-combat situations. With limits—even ones that are not usually reached—players tend to treat their Smoke Bomb as an exclusively combat-oriented ability.
### Layout: end frame

##Heading 2
ADDITIONAL UPGRADE

##Body text
At 3rd level, you’ve mastered the essential tools and have begun to tinker with ways to expand your arsenal. The number of upgrades you can have, based on your class level, increases by one. It increases by one again at 5th level (for a total of two more than shown in the Inventor class table).

##Heading 2
RECYCLE GADGETS

##Body text
Starting at 3rd level, you can disassemble your gadgets and create different ones during a long rest. When you finish the rest, you can replace any upgrade you have with a new one.

##Body text
The chosen upgrade must still be one that is valid for the level at which you gained the replaced upgrade. For example, at 9th level, you can only have one upgrade that has a 9th-level prerequisite.

##Body text
Additionally, if one of your gadgets is destroyed, you can use this feature to recreate it over the course of a long rest, which requires materials worth 20 gp.

##Heading 2
EXTRA ATTACK

##Body text
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

##Heading 2

##Body text
Your GM may allow you to take the Power Fist upgrade from the Warsmith specialization in place of an Impact Gauntlet, which is similar but deals 1d8 damage and lacks the finesse property. For the purpose of upgrades, Impact Gauntlets and Power Fists should be considered interchangeable.

##Body text
Mechanical Familiar 
##Body text
You create the blueprint for a small, mechanical creature. At the end of a long rest, you can choose to create a familiar based on it, casting the find familiar spell without expending a spell slot.

A creature that is immune to being grappled or restrained automatically succeeds on this check. If you succeed, the target is shackled to you or the nearby object, and it can only move if it’s able to move what it’s shackled to.

##Body text
Additionally, while shackled in this way, the target can’t teleport, travel to another plane of existence, alter its form (such as by the polymorph spell), or dematerialize.

GOLEMSMITH

##Body text
Golemsmiths are inventors who have committed themselves to creating a true work of artifice, forging a golem. With this painstaking life ambition, they plan and design meticulously, even if, in practice, sometimes compromises on materials must be made.

##Body text
Why a golemsmith embarks on the quest to forge this artificial construct of life can vary. For many it is the pure pursuit of forging the perfect creation; while for others, it is simply so they do not have to carry around their loot, or to have a loyal companion to count on at all times.

##Body text
A golemsmith is rarely chaotic, as they are people of great care and discipline—those that are not would not have succeeded where they have. However, some have been set on their path by such events that might drive them to interact chaotically with society as a whole.

##Heading 2
GOLEMSMITH'S PROFICIENCY

MECHANICAL GOLEM

Starting at 1st level, you forge a mechanical golem to carry out your orders and protect you. The golem is under your control and understands the languages you speak, but it can’t speak.

##Body text
The golem obeys your commands as best it can. On your turn, you can verbally command it where to move (no action required by you), and you can use your action to command it to take an action. Additionally, whenever it would be able to take a reaction, you must use your reaction to command it to take that reaction. The golem acts on your commands during your turn. If you issue no commands to your golem, it takes no actions.

##Body text
Your golem’s proficiency bonus increases when yours does. If the golem is killed, it can be returned to life by normal means, such as the revivify spell, or you can repair it during a long rest if you have access to its body. At the end of the long rest, it returns to life with half its hit points (rounded down).

##Body text
If the golem is beyond recovery, you can recreate it exactly as it was, with four days of work (8 hours each day) and 100 gp of raw materials.

##Body text
Over the course of a short rest, you can restore hit points to your golem equal to your Intelligence modifier + your inventor level, or you can fully repair it to during a long rest, causing it to regain all its hit points. Any spells you cast that cause the target to regain hit points ignore any restrictions against constructs for your golem.

##Body text
Your Golem Companion begins to apply its abilities to learn new things, gaining one level in a class of your choice. Your Golem Companion gains all the 1st-level features of the chosen class. This doesn’t include hit points, Hit Dice, or class proficiencies. For example, choosing the Fighter class grants the golem the Fighting Style and Second Wind features, but nothing else.

##Body text

##Body text
Brutal Armaments 
##Body text
You increase the effectiveness of your golem’s natural weapons, allowing it to attack with lethal strikes.

INFUSIONSMITH

##Body text
An infusionsmith is, in some ways, perhaps the most quintessential type of inventor. While other inventors may delve into mechanics and tinkering, an infusionsmith tinkers with magic itself.

##Body text
These inventors are on the cutting edge of magical engineering, understanding the principal applications of magic. Infusionsmiths would have ground to stand on in calling a wizard an impulsive spellslinger, for they are the inventors that work their magic through careful and meticulous study, laying down magic they may not use for hours, or painstakingly crafting a long-lasting enchantment.

##Body text
An infusionsmith can be a magical swordsman, a wandslinger, or a bookish supporting character with a bagful of tricks that never quite runs dry. Some will stand within a maelstrom of animated blades, while others will plink away with a crossbow that seems unerringly accurate, but their common theme is using their prowess of infusion to make themselves formidable.

##Heading 2
INFUSIONSMITH'S PROFICIENCY

##Body text
When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with calligrapher’s supplies and jeweler’s tools. Your knowledge of infusion magic also gives you a natural affinity for scribing spell scrolls. The time you must spend to create a magic spell scroll is halved.

##Heading 2
INFUSED ARMAMENT

##Body text
Starting at 1st level, you can infuse a powerful armament to take into battle. At the end of a long rest, select one of the infusions below. The infusion lasts until the end of your next long rest.

##Body text
Animated Weapon

##Body text
You touch a melee weapon, causing it to spring to life. This Animated Weapon can be carried or stowed like a normal weapon, or you can ready it, causing it to float beside you. While an Animated Weapon is readied, you can make attacks with it as part the Attack action, sending it out to strike a target. All attacks made with your Animated Weapon during a turn must be made against the same target.

##Body text
This special attack is a melee spell attack with which you are proficient. You can make this special attack against a target out to a range of 30 feet away from you. If the weapon has the heavy or special property, this range is halved to 15 feet; and if the weapon has the light property, this range is doubled to 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes damage equal to the weapon’s damage dice + your Intelligence modifier.

##Body text
Blasting Rod

##Body text
You touch a nonmagical object—a wand-blank, stick, staff, or rod—turning it into a Blasting Rod and infusing it with the ability to cast a cantrip. Select one evocation cantrip from the wizard spell list that doesn’t require concentration. Thereafter, as an action, you can use the Blasting Rod to cast that cantrip.

##Body text
Once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature or object with your Blasting Rod, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage dealt to that target.

##Body text
Infused Weapon

##Body text
You touch a weapon, enchanting it. While this weapon is enchanted, you (and only you) have proficiency with it. This Infused Weapon can be wielded like a normal weapon, but it gains the following special property:

##Body text
You can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the weapon’s attack and damage rolls. In addition, if the weapon has a single damage die, the size of that die increases by one (to a maximum of a d12). For example, if the Infused Weapon is a dagger, its damage die increases from a d4 to a d6.

##Heading 2
SPELL MANUAL

##Body text
At 3rd level, you have a Spell Manual containing two 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your Spell Manual is a repository of any non-inventor spell you know.

##Body text
You can’t cast spells from your Spell Manual, and they don’t count against your number of spells known, but whenever you would learn a new inventor spell, you can select a spell from your Spell Manual instead of the inventor spell list. That spell then becomes an inventor spell for you, and you can cast it as normal. You can choose to scribe any inventor spell you know into your Spell Manual, as if copying it from a written spell.

##Body text
Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher. Each time you gain an inventor level, you can add one wizard spell of your choice to your Spell Manual for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Inventor table.

##Body text
On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your Spell Manual. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp.

##Heading 2
INFUSE MAGIC

##Body text
Also at 3rd level, you can use your Spell Manual to infuse magic items, such as wands, storing magical power for later use. Over the course of 1 minute, you can perform a special ritual to cast a spell into the item, expending a spell slot as normal. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way.

##Body text
Thereafter, a creature holding the item that is aware there is magic infused in it can trigger the stored magic, casting the spell. The creature must have an Intelligence of 6 or higher to cast the spell in this way.

##Body text
The spell uses your spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability, but is in all other ways treated as if the creature holding it cast the spell. The spell infused in the item fades if you finish a long rest and the stored magic hasn’t been triggered.

##Heading 2
EXTRA ATTACK

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

##Heading 2
EMPOWERED INFUSIONS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
By the time you reach 5th level, your Infused Armament grows more powerful. If you infuse or animate a weapon, you can infuse or animate one additional weapon at the same time (having two Animated Weapons, two Infused Weapons, or one of each). If you have multiple Animated Weapons, you can attack the same or different targets with them during a turn.

##Body text
If you cast a spell of 1st level or higher using an item from Infuse Magic or an upgrade, or from a magic wand, you can cast the cantrip from your Blasting Rod as a bonus action.

##Heading 2
INFUSED FOCUS

##Body text
Starting at 14th level, you can anchor a powerful spell into an item. When you cast a spell that requires concentration, you can anchor it to an object you touch (such as a staff, wand, or weapon), causing the spell to not require your concentration. When you do so, the spell lasts a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier, after which the spell ends.

Benefits of Flexibility?

##Body text
If you choose to have an Animated and Infused Weapon, you can attack twice with either, but will limit yourself to being able to only attack one target if you solely rely on the Animated Weapon. If you animate two weapons, you can split your attacks like normal using one to attack a different creature. Alternatively, you can animate a short-range heavy weapon and a long-range light weapon, giving you more options at different ranges but limiting your ability to target multiple targets at any optimal range.

Animated Archer 
##Body text
You master animation enchantments, allowing you to use your Animate Weapon feature on a ranged weapon and a quiver of ammunition. An animated ranged weapon hovers near you, and you can make a ranged spell attack with it against a target within the weapon’s range.

##Body text
On a hit, the target takes damage equal to the weapon’s damage dice + your Intelligence modifier. The weapon requires ammunition, and it can carry up 30 pieces of ammunition at a time. You can reload the ammunition at any time as an action.

##Body text
Arcane Armament 
##Body text
You master armoring yourself with magical enchantments. You learn the mage armor spell. While under the effect of mage armor , you can add your Intelligence modifier to your AC, instead of your Dexterity modifier. You can only do this if you are not adding your Intelligence modifier to your AC from another source.

##Body text
Additionally, you gain resistance to force damage.

##Body text
Loyal Weapon 
##Body text
You can cast the returning weapon* spell without expending a spell slot, but if you cast it on a second weapon with this upgrade, the spell immediately fades from any previous use of this upgrade.

##Body text
Magical Wand of... 
##Body text
You create a new wand that you can infuse with a spell of 1st level or higher that you have recorded in your Spell Manual. This wand doesn’t require attunement, but can only be used by you. The spell must be of a level that you can cast as an inventor (as of when you would choose this upgrade). This wand has 3 charges.

##Body text
You can expend a charge to cast the chosen spell at its lowest level. The wand regains all expended charges when you finish a long rest.

##Body text
You can select this upgrade multiple times, choosing a different spell and creating a new wand each time you select this upgrade.

Magic Wand Spell Level

##Body text
A Magical Wand created using an upgrade slot at level 3 can always only ever cast 1st-level spells. For example, at level 5 if you have two Magical Wand upgrades, you will have one that can cast 1st-level spells, and one that can cast 2nd-level spells. Even if you later swap the upgrade, the Wand is still an Upgrade from level 3, and selected as if you are level 3 and only able to cast 1st-level spells.

Skilled Infusions 
##Body text
You manage to make the magic of your Animated and Infused Weapons so potent that attacks made with them gain the benefits of a fighting style. Attacks made with one-handed melee weapons gain Dueling, attacks made with two-handed melee weapons gain Great Weapon Fighting, and attacks made with ranged weapons gain Archery.

##Body text
Soul-Saving Bond 
##Body text
You set up a special magical bond between you and another creature. When either of the bonded creatures fails an Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, or death saving throw, the other creature can make the same saving throw, replacing the original result with its own. If this ability is used on a death saving throw, the roll is automatically a 20.

##Body text
Once this ability has been used to replace a roll, it can’t be used again until both bonded creatures have finished a short or long rest.

##Body text
This bond can be set up with a different creature at the end of a long rest.

##Body text
Warding Stone 
##Body text
You learn how to weave a protective enchantment on an item. That item gains a pool of temporary hit points equal to your Inventor level. Any creature carrying the item gains any temporary hit points remaining in its pool, but these hit points are lost if that creature is no longer carrying the item.

##Body text
The item’s pool of temporary hit points replenishes when you finish a long rest.

##Body text
Worn Enchantment 
##Body text
You can enchant an item you are wearing, such as a cloak or scarf, to animate and assist you with a task, be it climbing a wall, grappling an enemy, or picking a lock. You can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher as an action to gain proficiency in one Strength- or Dexterity-based skill of your choice until you finish a long rest.

##Body text
Additionally, you can choose to use up all the magic in the item to gain advantage on one ability check using the chosen skill. After you do so, you lose the proficiency granted by this upgrade.

Animated Shield 
##Body text
You apply your animation magic to a shield. At the end of a long rest, you can touch a shield, causing it to spring to life and protect you until you finish your next long rest. While it is protecting you, you gain the benefits of the shield as if you were wielding it. As usual, you can benefit from only one shield at a time.

##Body text
While you have an animated shield, you can also send it to defend your allies. When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. When you do so, you lose the benefits of the animated shield until the start of your next turn.

##Body text
Arcane Ammunition 
##Body text
You infuse a ranged weapon with special, arcane magic. The weapon no longer requires ammunition to fire, as it creates magical ammunition when you fire it, and whenever you hit a target with this magical ammunition, the attack deals force damage, instead of the weapon’s normal damage type.

##Body text
Additionally, if the weapon had the loading property, it no longer has that property.

##Body text
Deflecting Weapon 
##Body text
While you have an animated melee weapon, you can use your reaction when a creature makes a weapon attack against you to attempt to block it, rolling a d8 and adding the number rolled to your AC for that attack. You make this choice after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM says whether the attack hits or misses. If you attempt to block a melee weapon attack in this way and the attack misses, you can immediately make one weapon attack against the attacker as part of the same reaction.
##Body text
When you use this ability, if you take the Attack action on your next turn, you can only make one weapon attack as part of that action. This attack can’t be made with the animated weapon you used to attempt to block the attack.

##Body text
Weapon Enchantment Expertise 
##Body text
When you cast arcane weapon* , magic weapon , or vorpal weapon* , the targeted weapon deals an extra 1d4 force damage, and when you cast prismatic weapon* , the extra damage it deals increases by 1d4.

Dimensional Pockets 
##Body text
You enchant a pocket on your gear to contain far more than it would appear. That pocket can hold up to 50 pounds, and you can put any object in it that can fit through a 6-inch-diameter opening. The pocket otherwise behaves like a bag of holding.

##Body text
Invisibility Cloak 
##Body text
You make an invisibility cloak. While wearing this cloak, a creature can cast invisibility on itself, without expending a spell slot or material components. When cast in this way, the spell doesn’t require the caster’s concentration. The spell ends if the caster is no longer wearing the cloak or if they choose to end the spell early (no action required).

##Body text
Once a creature uses the cloak to cast this spell, it can’t be used in this way again until you finish a short or long rest.

##Body text
Prepared Enchantment 
##Body text
You can cast a limited version of contingency , without expending a spell slot or material components, as you bestow magical enchantments onto your gear. When you cast the spell in this way, it ends if you finish a long rest before the contingent spell is triggered, and the contingent spell must be a spell of 2nd level or lower.

##Body text
Once you cast contingency in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

##Body text
Spell-Trapping Ring 
##Body text
At the end of a long rest, you can set a powerful magic into a nonmagical ring you touch. You can use this ring to cast counterspell without expending a spell slot. When you cast counterspell in this way and it succeeds, the spell you countered is stored in the ring. You can cast the stored spell from the ring without expending a spell slot, but that spell fades if you don’t cast it before you finish a long rest.

##Body text
Once you cast counterspell to store a spell in this ring, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

You create a new rod that you can infuse with a spell of 5th level or higher that you have recorded in your Spell Manual. This rod doesn’t require attunement, but can only be used by you. The spell must be of a level no higher than half your inventor level (as of when you would choose this upgrade), rounded down.

##Body text
You can use the rod to cast the chosen spell at its lowest level. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. You can select this upgrade multiple times, choosing a different spell and creating a new rod each time you select this upgrade.

POTIONSMITH

##Body text
A potionsmith is an inventor who has pursued the secrets of alchemy. While many a village has an apothecary grinding odd herbs and roots into potent (or not so potent) concoctions, the careful process of mixing and brewing is just one way to achieve results. Through the use of the intricate secrets of the craft and direct infusions using magical rituals, a potionsmith can come up with explosive results in the blink of an eye... sometimes literally.

##Body text
A potionsmith can be a scholar who has delved into the knowledge the world has to offer or an explorer that has unlocked the secrets of the wilderness. Their knowledge could come from being friends of the fey or from unfettered access to the royal library. As such, potionsmith’s can be good or evil, lawful or chaotic.

##Heading 2
POTIONSMITH'S PROFICIENCY

##Body text
When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with blowguns, alchemist’s supplies, and the herbalism kit.

##Body text
Your knowledge of alchemy gives you a natural affinity for brewing potions. Creating a potion through normal crafting takes you only half the time it would normally take.

##Heading 2
ALCHEMICAL REAGENTS POUCH

##Body text
At 1st level, you’ve acquired a pouch of useful basic reagents, much as a wizard might carry a component pouch. You’ve tucked away things that will come in handy, and can retrieve them as part of using an ability that might require them. As long as you have this pouch on you, you can use the potionsmith’s features. This pouch is considered to be alchemist’s supplies for the purposes of crafting.

##Body text
If you lose your reagent pouch, you can spend 50 gp to reacquire the various stocks you need, or spend 1 full day gathering them from a natural environment without expense.

Alchemists and Potions

##Body text
Immediately on making a potionsmith, one may think of the magic potions that exist in most settings—from the simple potion of healing to the legendary potion of storm giant strength. However, someone does not need to be a potionsmith to make these, as crafting rules for them are open to all classes.

##Body text
A potionsmith with their proficiency will certainly have the edge in potion crafting, but these potions are not fundamental to the class.

INSTANT REACTIONS

##Body text
At 1st level, you know how to get instant reactions to occur without the niceties of grinding, simmering, and brewing required for more refined concoctions.

##Body text
Moreover, you know enough ways to do these processes that with just a few standard supplies, you can get results out of a wide range of things you can gather in almost any locale and a pinch from your reagent pouch.

##Body text
Pick three instant reactions from the following: Alchemical Acid, Alchemical Fire, Fortifying Fumes, Healing Draught, and Poisonous Gas. These instant reactions don’t count against your number of upgrades known.

##Heading 2
ALCHEMICAL INFUSIONS

##Body text
At 3rd level, you have discovered the secrets to drastically bypass the alchemical brewing process, crafting potent magical effects through the direct infusion of the potion with your own magic. When you finish a short or long rest, you can create any number of potions, choosing one of the following spells for each potion and expending a spell slot as if you were casting the spell. You must provide an empty vial for each potion you create in this way.

###Table:Table - Heading

##Body text
When you do so, the spell doesn’t take effect immediately, but is instead infused into the potion.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
If the spell grants an effect or restores hit points, a creature can consume it or administer it to another creature as an action. If a spell targets an area of effect, you can accurately throw the vial up to 30 feet, dealing no inherent damage, but breaking the vial on impact. The area of effect takes place when the vial is broken, with the effect centered on where the vial breaks. If the spell targets a creature, you can treat the vial as a ranged weapon with which you are proficient, and it has the thrown (20/60) property. You replace the spell attack with making a weapon attack made with the vial.

##Body text
If the spell has a non-instantaneous effect that normally requires concentration, it doesn’t require your concentration when it takes effect in this way, but its duration is shortened to a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). A spell that doesn’t require concentration lasts its normal duration. An infused potion loses its potency if it isn’t used by the end of your next long rest.

UNRESTRICTED UPGRADES

##Body text
Alchemical Acid (Instant Reaction) 
##Body text
As an action, you can produce an instant reaction, throwing this combination of reagents at a point within 20 feet of you, which causes a caustic acid to splatter the area within a 5-footradius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d4 acid damage. Damage from this acid deals double damage to objects and structures.

##Body text
The damage increases by 2d4 when you reach 5th level (4d4), 11th level (6d4), and 17th level (8d4).

##Body text
Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to prepare this instant reaction as a ranged weapon with which you are proficient. It lasts until the end of your turn, and it has the finesse and thrown (20/60) properties. On a hit, it deals damage equal to failing the saving throw against this effect. The damage dealt by this attack doesn’t include your Strength or Dexterity modifier.

##Body text
Alchemical Fire (Instant Reaction) 
##Body text
As an action, you can produce an instant reaction, tossing a quick combination of reagents at a point within 20 feet of you, which causes searing fire to flare up in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d8 fire damage.

##Body text
This damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

##Body text
Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to prepare this instant reaction as a ranged weapon with which you are proficient. It lasts until the end of your turn, and it has the finesse and thrown (20/60) properties. On a hit, it deals damage equal to failing the saving throw against this effect. The damage dealt by this attack doesn’t include your Strength or Dexterity modifier.

##Body text
Delivery Mechanism 
##Body text
You modify the stability of your reagents and develop a better delivery mechanism. You can target a point within 40 feet of you for your instant reactions (including ones gained from upgrades, such as Explosive Reaction) and infused potions that target a point. This additional precision enables you to better target the effects, allowing each creature of your choice in the area to automatically succeed on its Dexterity saving throw against the effects of your instant reactions and infused potions.

##Body text
Additionally, when making an attack roll with an instant reaction or infused potion, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Dexterity modifier, for the attack roll.

##Body text
Dragon Draught (Instant Reaction; upgrade only) 
##Body text
As an action, you can quaff a vial of highly reactive liquid, allowing you to immediately belch a blast of devastating elemental energy. Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, or lightning.

##Body text
If you choose cold or fire damage, the area of effect is a 10-foot cone; if you choose acid or lightning damage, the area of effect is a 15-foot line. Each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d8 damage of the chosen type.

##Body text
The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

##Body text
Explosive Reaction (Instant Reaction; upgrade only) 
##Body text
As an action, you can produce an instant reaction, throwing a devastating combination of reagents at a point within 20 feet of you, which causes a minor explosion. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d10 thunder damage from the shockwave of the explosion.

##Body text
The damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

##Body text
Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to prepare this instant reaction as a ranged weapon with which you are proficient. It lasts until the end of your turn, and it has the finesse and thrown (20/60) properties. On a hit, it deals damage equal to failing the saving throw against this effect. The damage dealt by this attack doesn’t include your Strength or Dexterity modifier.

##Body text
Flaming Grease 
##Body text
You tweak your grease formula to be flammable, as grease should be. When you cast grease or use it to make an infused potion, the effect becomes flammable. If the grease takes fire damage, all creatures in the spell’s area take 2d4 fire damage. The grease burns for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).

##Body text
Additionally, when you cast the grease spell or use it as an infused potion, you can instead use it to coat a weapon. This coating lasts for 1 hour or until it takes fire damage, igniting the grease. Once ignited, that weapon deals an extra 1d4 fire damage on a hit for the next minute.

##Body text
Fortifying Fumes Reaction (Instant Reaction) 
##Body text
As an action, you can produce an instant reaction, throwing a fortifying stimulus of reagents at a point within 20 feet of you, which causes fumes to erupt. Each creature within 10 feet of that point can choose to hold its breath and not inhale the fumes, but creatures that do inhale them gain 1d4 temporary hit points, deal an extra 1d4 damage on their next melee weapon attack, and have advantage on their next Constitution saving throw. Any remaining benefits from this effect fade at the end of your next turn.

##Body text
Both the temporary hit points and the extra damage increase by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

##Body text
Frostbloom Reaction (Instant Reaction; upgrade only) 
##Body text
As an action, you can produce an instant reaction, throwing a combination of devastating, endothermically reactive reagents at a point within 20 feet of you, which causes a bloom of ice to erupt. The area within 5 feet of that point becomes difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

##Body text
Each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or be caught by the ice, taking 1d6 cold damage. If a creature that fails its saving throw is entirely in the area of effect, it becomes restrained until the end of its next turn. A restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.

##Body text
The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

##Body text
Healing Draught (Instant Reaction) 
##Body text
As a bonus action, you can produce an instant reaction that provides potent magical healing. A creature can use its action to consume this draught or administer it to another creature within 5 feet of it before the start of your next turn, causing the target to regain 1d8 hit points. If you have the Practiced Quaff feature, you can consume a Healing Draught as part of the bonus action used to make it.

##Body text
A creature can benefit from a number of these draughts up to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), after which they provide no benefit to that creature until it finishes a long rest. A Healing Draught that isn’t consumed before the start of your next turn loses its potency.

##Body text
The number of hit points the draught restores increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

##Body text
Homunculus Familiar 
##Body text
You learn the alchemical process for creating a homunculus minion. You can cast find familiar without expending a spell slot or material components other than your alchemical reagents and blood. This familiar can appear in any Tiny shape you want, though it uses the statistics of a creature that can normally be chosen by the spell, and it is a construct or monstrosity, rather than one of the types listed in the spell.

##Body text
Inoculations 
##Body text
You gain resistance to poison damage.

##Body text
Additionally, at the end of a long rest, you can choose up to five creatures (including yourself) to become inoculated against poisonous effects you can produce that require a Constitution saving throw (such as the Poisonous Gas instant reaction or the cloudkill alchemical infusion). You and each of the chosen creatures automatically succeed on saving throws against these effects until the end of your next long rest.

##Body text
Long Acting 
##Body text
If the spell you infuse into an infused potion would normally require concentration, its duration is now a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus.

##Body text
Persistent Reactions 
##Body text
Your instant reactions that have an area of effect persist in that area until the start of your next turn. While they persist, each creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there must repeat the saving throw against the effect. You can choose to make the effect not persist in this way when you take the action to produce the instant reaction.

##Body text
Poisoner’s Proficiency 
##Body text
You delve into the darkest, most mysterious depths of herbal lore, learning the potent secrets of poison. You gain proficiency with poisoner’s kits; if you already have this proficiency, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using a poisoner’s kit. Additionally, during a long rest, you can create one of the following poisons of your choice:

##Bullet
 • Contact Poison. You can apply this poison to a melee weapon or up to ten pieces of ammunition. That weapon or ammunition deals an extra 1d4 poison damage on a hit; the weapon can deal this poison damage 10 times before the poison wears off.
##Bullet
 • Ingested Poison. This poison is a simple, flavorless powder. If a creature consumes a full dose of the poison, it must make a Constitution saving throw with disadvantage against your spell save DC. After 1 minute, if the creature failed its saving throw, it takes 1d10 poison damage per level you have in this class, and it becomes poisoned until it finishes a long rest.
##Bullet
 • Inhaled Poison. You can use this dose of poison to increase the size and potency of your Poisonous Gas instant reaction. When you do so, the fumes erupt in a 20-footradius sphere and the effect’s damage dice are doubled.

##Body text
Any unused poison loses its potency and no longer has any effect after you finish your next long rest.

##Body text
Poisonous Gas (Instant Reaction) 
##Body text
As an action, you can produce an instant reaction, tossing a quick combination of reagents at a point within 20 feet of you, which causes noxious fumes to erupt in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d4 poison damage and become poisoned until the end of its next turn.
##Body text
The damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

Weapon Coating 
##Body text
As a bonus action, you can apply one of your instant reactions to a melee weapon or piece of ammunition. The next time you hit a target with that weapon or ammunition before the end of your next turn, the target is subjected to the effects of the applied instant reaction. The creature automatically takes the damage or healing associated with the instant reaction, but makes a saving throw as normal against any additional effects.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
The Implications

##Body text
There is an instant reaction that restores hit points, rather than deals damage. This can be applied via the Weapon Coating upgrade as well, though the weapon will still deal its damage on a hit. Perhaps your allies will forgive a blowgun dart coated in a healing draught...if you can hit with the attack.

5TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

##Body text
Adrenaline Serum
##Body text
 You learn to create a potent serum. As a bonus action, you can consume a dose of this serum, increasing your Strength and Dexterity modifiers by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier (up to a maximum of +5) for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), after which all effects of the serum fade at the start of your next turn. While you are under the effect of this serum, you also gain the benefits of the heroism spell. When these effects end, your speed is halved and you can’t benefit from your Adrenaline Serum again until the start of your next turn.

##Body text
Explosive Powder (Prerequisite: Explosive Reaction) 
##Body text
You’ve managed to stabilize and refine your Explosive Reaction. You can prepare a number of Explosive Reactions up to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of 1). These Explosive Reactions don’t detonate instantly, but rather last for 1 minute and will only detonate when exposed to fire. A creature can be affected by the damage from no more than two Explosive Reactions simultaneously, but structures take the full damage of all Explosive Reactions in their area.

##Body text
Resistance Potion 
##Body text
You create a formula for making a simplified temporary resistance potion. During a long rest, you can create a potion that grants the drinker resistance to acid, cold, fire, lighting, poison, or thunder damage (selected during the long rest) for 10 minutes when consumed. If not consumed, it loses potency when you finish your next long rest.

##Heading 2
9TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

##Body text
Aroma Therapies 
##Body text
You expand your alchemical knowledge to be able to produce incense and simmering reagents that grant benefits to those that inhale their fumes. A creature that spends a long rest surrounded by these fumes regains an additional 2d4 Hit Dice, its exhaustion level is reduced by 1d4 (instead of 1), and it is cured of any nonmagical diseases it’s suffering from.

##Body text
Infusion Stone 
##Body text
You use the secrets of alchemy to create an Infusion Stone. You can use this stone in the process of infusing potions in place of expending a spell slot level. The spell you infuse in this way must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
##Body text
Once you use the Infusion Stone, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

##Body text
Mana Potion 
##Body text
During a short rest, you can create a mana potion. A mana potion loses its potency if it isn’t consumed within 1 hour. As an action, a creature can consume a mana potion to regain one expended spell slot of its choice that is 3rd level or lower.

##Body text
Potent Reactions 
##Body text
You refine your instant reactions, increasing their potency. The die you roll to determine the damage or healing effect of your instant reactions is increased by one size: a d4 becomes a d6, a d6 becomes a d8, a d8 becomes a d10, and a d10 becomes a d12.

##Body text
Rocketry (Prerequisite: Explosive Reaction and Delivery Mechanism) 
##Body text
Combining your understanding of explosives with advances in delivery and stabilization, you produce the logical extreme: powering a rocket-based payload with your devastating knowledge.

##Body text
You can choose any instant reaction you know as the payload for your rocket. Rockets must be prepared ahead of time, and you can prepare a number of them up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) at the end of a short or long rest. When you finish a rest, any unused rockets lose their potency and must be remade due to their volatile components.

##Body text
A rocket targets a point you can see within 500 feet of you, but the DC of the instant reaction’s saving throw is reduced by 2 for every 100 feet it travels. When the rocket reaches its destination, the instant reaction takes effect, centered on that point.

##Body text
Alternatively, you can load an alternate payload into your rockets, which can be an object that weighs no more than 1 pound, replacing the effect of the instant reaction. This alternate payload can be salvaged during a rest.

Field Infusion 
##Body text
You can create an infused potion as an action.

##Body text
Once you create an infused potion in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

##Body text
Mutation Mixture (Prerequisite: 13th-level Inventor) 
##Body text
You concoct an infused potion that can rapidly warp a creature’s body, temporarily mutating it in extreme ways. You add the polymorph spell to your list of available spells for your Alchemical Infusions. When a creature consumes this infused potion, the spell has a duration of 1 hour, but the creature that consumed it can end the effect early as an action.

##Body text
Once a creature consumes this infused potion, it can’t be affected by the polymorph spell in this way again until it finishes a long rest.

##Body text
Panacea 
##Body text
When you create a Healing Draught, you can add a more potent concoction to it. A creature that consumes this potent draught can treat any dice rolled to determine the hit points it regains as having rolled their maximum value, and the creature gains the benefit of a greater restoration spell.

##Body text
Once you create a Healing Draught in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

##Body text
Perfect Reaction 
##Body text
In a moment of perfect focus, you can create a flawless instant reaction. When you deal damage, grant temporary hit points, or restore hit points to a creature with this instant reaction, you can use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.

##Body text
Once you create a Perfect Reaction, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Adrenaline Rush (Prerequisite: Adrenaline Serum) 
##Body text
While under the effects of your Adrenaline Serum, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

##Body text
Mad Alchemy 
##Body text
Whenever you create an infused potion, you can infuse two spells into it, instead of one, which activate simultaneously.

##Body text
Philosopher’s Stone 
##Body text
You create a Philosopher’s Stone, allowing you to recreate wonders of alchemy. As long as you have a supply of non-gold metal, you can create up to 1 pound of gold each day (50 gp worth). Additionally, the Philosopher’s Stone can be used in place of a diamond worth up to 500 gp for a spell’s material component; it isn’t consumed when used in this way, but it becomes inert for 24 hours, providing no benefits.

##Body text
You can brew a special potion using your Philosopher’s Stone called an Elixir of Life. Brewing this potion takes 8 hours and requires crushing a diamond worth at least 2,000 gp into it. An Elixir of Life causes a creature that drinks it to cease aging for 4d4 years. A creature that drinks this elixir also gains the effect of a death ward spell, which lasts until it is triggered, instead of 8 hours.

##Body text
A more potent Elixir of Life can be created, increasing the number of years that the creature ceases aging by 1d4 for each additional diamond spent.

THUNDERSMITH

##Body text
A Thundersmith is an inventor who harnesses the primal force of elemental power, channeling that power into their great creation: a weapon of unmatched devastation. Spectacular and terrible, these weapons bring fear to their foes and awe to their allies.

##Body text
Why a Thundersmith bends their mind to the task of making such a weapon are as varied as the creations themselves. Some are coldly analytical about the destruction it causes seeking to continually improve it, tweaking it for ever more optimized destruction, while others view it merely as a tool, a means to an end; others still revel in the crash of thunder that heralds the terrifying force of their weapon.

##Body text
Many look at these weapons as the dawn of a new age, in truth wielding them is a tricky and arcane art; as complex as its creation it is only truly understood and mastered by the one who forged the device—each weapon a unique piece of devastating art.

##Heading 2
THUNDERSMITH'S PROFICIENCY

##Body text
When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with tinker’s tools and smith’s tools.

##Body text
If your weapon requires ammunition, you gain the knowledge of how to forge and create it with smith’s tools during a long rest. You can create up to 50 rounds of ammunition during a long rest, with materials costing 1 gp per 10 rounds.

##Heading 2
STORMFORGED WEAPON

##Body text
Starting at 1st level, you harness the elemental power of thundering storms to create a powerful weapon. This weapon requires attunement, only you can attune to it, you are proficient with it while attuned, and you can only be attuned to one Stormforged Weapon at a time. If you have multiple Stormforged Weapons, you can change which one you are attuned to during a long rest.

##Body text
If you lose your Stormforged Weapon or wish to create additional ones, you can do so over the course of three days (8 hours each day) by expending 200 gp worth of metal and other raw materials. When you make a new Stormforged Weapon, you can make the same or a different type, and select the same or different upgrades.

##Body text
Select one of the following and consult the Stormforged Weapon table for its statistics.

##Heading 2
STORMFORGED WEAPONS

##Heading 2

##Body text
¹Stormcharged. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a Stormcharged Weapon, you can make only one Attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. If you could otherwise make additional attacks with that action, the weapon deals an extra 3d6 lightning or thunder damage per attack that was foregone. 
##Body text
²Loud. Your weapon rings with thunder that is audible within 300 feet of you whenever it makes an attack.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Thunder Cannon

##Body text
You use the power of thunder to launch a projectile with terrible power, if limited accuracy, over long distances. Ringing out with a booming crash, it brings fear to the battlefield.

##Body text
Hand Cannon

##Body text
Forgoing the guiding barrel, this pack uses the thundering power to launch a projectile with all the force of a Cannon, though its effective range is far more limited.

##Body text
Kinetic Hammer

##Body text
Rather than launching a projectile with the thundering force, you keep that force imbued in the weapon, allowing for devastating force to be applied to the attack.

##Body text
Charged Blade

##Body text
You create a bladed weapon that channels the harnessed power of the elemental storm power directly into the blade, causing it to lay waste to all it strikes. This weapon deals lightning damage instead of thunder when applying Thundermonger.

Firearms in a Campaign Setting

##Body text
A lot of campaign settings do not feature firearms, and in some of these the Thundersmith variant of inventor might not be the right choice, but consider that the inventor is fundamentally someone that tinkers with and explores boundaries of magic as much as or more so than technology.

##Body text
A Thunder Cannon need not be a gunpowder powered device, even in a setting where gunpowder exists, but can be powered by harnessing elemental powers, bound through various carefully researched magical techniques. In most cases, the wonders of an inventor are more an engineering marvel of magic than technology, but that balance can shift depending on what is best for your setting.
### Layout: end frame

##Body text
Lightning Pike

##Body text
You create a charged blade and stick it to the end of a pole, making it slightly more unwieldy, but giving it devastating reach. This weapon deals lightning damage instead of thunder when applying Thundermonger.

THUNDERMONGER

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
At 3rd level, the elemental might of your weapon is so powerful its strikes deal bonus thunder damage.

##Body text
When you hit a target with your Stormforged Weapon, you can deal an extra 1d6 thunder damage. After discharging this bonus damage, you can’t deal this bonus damage again until the start of your next turn.

##Body text
This extra damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels in this class: 5th level (2d6), 7th level (3d6), 9th level (4d6), 11th level (5d6), 13th level (6d6), 15th level (7d6), 17th level (8d6), and 19th level (9d6).

Stormcharged vs. Thundermonger

##Body text
A common question is why does the Stormcharged Property exist and how does it interact with Thundermonger? Functionally, the stormcharged property (like the loading property) has no effect on a single classed Thundersmith, it just exists to make Stormforged Weapons interact better with Extra Attack for multiclassing and Cross-Disciplinary Knowledge.

##Heading 2
DEVASTATING BLASTS

##Body text
Beginning at 5th level, when you miss an attack with your Thundering Weapon, you can apply Thundermonger damage to the target creature you missed, but it deals only half the bonus damage. Dealing damage this way counts as applying Thundermonger damage.

##Heading 2
UNLEASHED POWER

##Body text
Starting at 14th level, when rolling damage for Thundermonger or your Stormforged Weapon, you can expend a spell slot to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one) and maximize a number of dice equal to the level of the spell slot expended. (You may maximize the dice rerolled this way, or the dice that were not rerolled) You must use the new rolls.

Extended Range 
##Body text
You extend the reach of your Stormforged Weapon. If your Stormforged Weapon has the ammunition property, its range is extended; normal range is extended by 30 feet, and maximum range is extended by 90 feet. If your Stormforged Weapon is a melee weapon with the two-handed property, it gains the reach property.

##Body text
Lightning Burst 
##Body text
You upgrade your Stormforged Weapon to discharge its power within a 5-foot-wide 60-foot-long line. If you have not dealt Thundermonger damage since the start of your turn, as an action, you can make a special attack. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take damage equal to the bonus damage of Thundermonger as lightning damage on a failed save, half as much on a successful save.

##Body text
This counts as discharging your Thundermonger damage. Firing in this way doesn’t consume ammo.

##Body text
Lightning Magic 
##Body text
After a long study of the internal workings of your Stormforged Weapon, your mastery of lightning and thunder magic is such that you learn the following spells at the following levels and can cast them as Inventor Spells.

Silencer (Incompatible with Echoing Boom)

Shock Absorber 
##Body text
You add a reclamation device to your Stormforged Weapon to gather energy from the surroundings when it is present. As a reaction to taking Lightning or Thunder damage, you can gain resistance to that damage type until the start of your next turn. When you do so, the next time you roll Thundermonger damage before the end of your next turn, it deals an extra 1d6 damage.

##Body text
Sonic Movement (Prerequisite: Stormforged weapon that can deal Thunder damage) 
##Body text
You recalibrate and rebalance your weapon to leverage the backdraft of the force it exerts. When you make an attack with your Stormforged weapon that would deal thunder damage on your turn, you are knocked 5 feet away from the target you attacked. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

##Body text
Storm Blast 
##Body text
You can make a special attack with your Stormforged Weapon, unleashing a storm blast in a 30-foot cone as an action. Each creature in the area must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, or take damage equal to the bonus damage of Thundermonger and be knocked prone.

##Body text
This counts as discharging your Thundermonger damage. Firing in this way doesn’t consume ammo.

##Body text
If using a Kinetic Hammer, you can use your Strength to calculate the DC of this ability (8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus) instead of your spell save DC.

##Body text
Twin Thunder 
##Body text
You can attune to two one-handed Stormforged Weapons at the same time, so long as they either share the same Upgrades, or have total Upgrades equal to your maximum Upgrade count between them. Attuning to a second weapon this way doesn’t count against your maximum number of attuned items. If you make an attack with one of them while holding the other, you can attack with the other as a bonus action, however, both share the same use of Thundermonger. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative or you have the Two Weapon Fighting Fighting Style.

##Body text
While dual wielding Stormforged Weapon, you can load a Stormforged Weapon without a free hand.

##Body text
Weapon Improvement

Echoing Boom (Incompatible with Silencer) 
##Body text
You pack extra power into your Thundermonger, increasing the damage it deals by 1d6.

##Body text
Harpoon Reel 
##Body text
You devise an alternate attack method for your Stormforged Weapon that launches a harpoon attached to a tightly coiled cord. This attack has a normal range of 30 feet and a maximum range of 60 feet, and it deals 1d6 piercing damage. This attack doesn’t apply Thundermonger damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.

##Body text
A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the Harpoon unless it removes the Harpoon as an action, which causes it to take an extra 1d6 damage. While the Harpoon is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cord. Dragging the connected party via the attached cord causes the creature moving to move at half speed unless they are a size category larger.

##Body text
While connected in this manner, you can use your bonus action to activate the Reel action, pulling yourself to the location if the target is Medium or larger. A Small or smaller creature is pulled back to you, ending the connection. Alternatively, you can opt to disconnect the cord.

##Body text
This attack can’t be used again until the Reel action is taken.

Connected...By a Rope

Note that Harpooning a creature means that there is a rope connecting you to them. While you can use this to move them as per the ability, they can also use this to move you, particularly if they are substantially larger. Many Thundersmiths were last seen saying “I got this” and then Harpooning a dragon. User discretion is advised.

You add an additional amplifier to maximize the shock and awe value of your Stormforged Weapon. The first time a target takes damage from Thundermonger, they are deafened until the end of their next turn.
##Body text
Additionally, they must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become frightened of you for one minute. They can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of their turns.

Elemental Swapping

You upgrade the firing chamber for more adaptable damage. When you take the attack action with your Stormforged Weapon you can adjust its elemental properties, causing any bonus damage granted by Thundermonger to deal acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage instead of thunder damage.

##Body text
Alternatively, you can use a vial of holy water to cause your next Thundermonger bonus damage to deal radiant damage.

##Body text
Mortar Shells (Prerequisite: Stormforged weapon with the Ammunition property) 
##Body text
You build an alternate fire mode allowing you to fire your Stormforged Weapon like a mortar. Pick a target point within range, and make an attack roll. Apply the attack roll to all creatures within a 5-foot radius of the target point. Creatures hit take the weapon's damage plus half of the Thundermonger bonus damage. Dealing damage this way counts as applying Thundermonger damage for the turn. If you miss all targets, you can apply Devestating Blasts as normal.

##Body text
Creatures do not benefit from cover against this fire mode unless they have overhead cover as well.

##Body text
Ride the Lightning (Prerequisite: Lightning Burst) 
##Body text
When you use the Lightning Burst ability, you can opt to expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to infuse yourself into the burst of power. When you do so you are teleported up to 60 feet in the direction of the Lightning Burst (ending early if the Lighting Burst is blocked by an obstacle). You can stop anywhere along the path of the Lighting Burst, but the line will stop where you do.

##Body text
Shock Harpoon (Prerequisite: Harpoon Reel) 
##Body text
After hitting a creature with the Harpoon fire mode, you can use a bonus action to deliver a shock. If you have not dealt Thundermonger damage since the start of your turn, you can deal damage equal to your Thundermonger bonus damage as lightning damage. This counts as discharging your Thundermonger damage. Additionally, the target must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

##Body text
Once used, the Harpoon must be reeled in before this can be used again.

##Body text
Synaptic Feedback 
##Body text
You install a feedback loop into your cannon, allowing you to siphon some energy from your Stormforged Weapon to empower your reflexes.
##Body text
Whenever you deal lightning damage with your Stormforged Weapon your walking speed increases by 10ft and you can take the Dash or Disengage actions as a bonus action. This effect lasts until the end of your turn.

##Body text
Thunder Jump 
##Body text
You build a quick release for the arcane thundering energy that fills your Stormforged Weapon. As an action you can discharge your Thunder Cannon downward, launching yourself up to 60 feet in any direction. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks, and you carry up to one willing creature of your choice within 5 feet with you. Neither you or the carried creature takes falling damage on landing.

##Body text
Creatures that are within 10 feet of you when you use this ability must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On failure, they take damage equal to half of your Thundermonger damage. On success, they take half as much damage. This counts as discharging your Thundermonger damage. Firing in this way doesn’t consume ammo.

##Body text
Transforming Weapon (Prerequisite: Adaptable Weapon)

After dealing thunder damage on your turn, you can create a burst of thunderous sound that can be heard up to 100 feet away as a bonus action. Each creature within 5 feet, other than you, must make a Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 thunder damage You can do this a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, regaining all uses after a long rest. This damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 17th level to a total of 4d6.

When making a ranged weapon attack with your Stormforged Weapon, if neither you nor your target has moved since your last ranged attack against them, then you gain advantage on the attack. Also, being prone no longer causes you to have disadvantage when making a ranged weapon attack with your Stormforged Weapon.

##Heading 2
15TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

##Body text
Massive Overload (Prerequisite: Storm Blast or Lightning Burst) 
##Body text
Before making an attack with your Stormforged Weapon, you can expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use Storm Blast or Lightning Burst at the same time as making an attack; in this case the Storm Blast or Lightning Burst is powered by the spell slot and doesn’t count as applying Thundermonger for that turn. The direction of this secondary ability is the same as your attack.

##Body text
Doing this damages your Stormforged Weapon and you must spend an action to repair it before you can fire again. You must have the secondary ability unlocked as an upgrade to use it.

##Body text
Masterwork Weapon (Prerequisite: Weapon Improvement) 
##Body text
The bonus to attack and damage rolls for your Stormforged Weapon increases by +2 (stacking with any existing bonus from Weapon Improvement or Arcane Retrofit), up to a maximum of +4.

##Heading 2
WARSMITH

##Body text
A Warsmith is an Inventor that has turned their wondrous talent of invention to a singular goal: making themselves a juggernaut of war. The reasons behind this could be benevolent or nefarious. Some Warsmiths seek to turn their invention into a machine of death and terror; others become the arbiter of justice and order, and others still perhaps merely seek to refine their craft in pursuit of pure innovation.

##Body text
Because few individuals would pursue such a wondrous invention without a driven purpose to their endeavor, warsmiths tend to be lawful. Usually driven to their actions by a greater purpose, they seek the power to accomplish their aims, be it righting the wrongs of the world or bringing it to heel beneath their ironshod boot.

##Heading 2
WARSMITH'S PROFICIENCY

##Body text
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor, tinker’s tools and smith’s tools.

##Heading 2
WARPLATE GAUNTLET

##Body text
At 1st level, when you take this specialization, you construct a Warplate Gauntlet. This is a specialized Wondrous Item that only you can attune to. When you create a Warplate Gauntlet, you can add one of the following upgrades to it: Power Fist, Force Blast, or Martial Grip. This upgrade doesn’t count against your upgrade total. You can make multiple gauntlets with different upgrades, but can only be attuned to one at a time.

##Body text
If you lose your Warplate Gauntlet, you can remake it during a long rest with 25 gp worth of materials, or can scavenge for materials and forge it over two days of work (8 hours each day) without the material expense.

##Body text
While wearing a Warplate Gauntlet, you can engage Artificial Strength.

##Body text
Artificial Strength

##Body text
When you don your Warplate Gauntlet or as an action while wearing it, you can dedicate some of your intelligence to fully controlling the power of the gauntlet. You can reduce your current and maximum Intelligence score to increase your current Strength ability score by the same amount, but you can only raise your Strength ability score up to what your Intelligence ability score was before engaging Artificial Strength. You can stop using Artificial Strength at any time, and it automatically ends if your gauntlet is removed.

##Heading 2
WARSMITH'S ARMOR

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
At 3rd level, you’ve attained the knowledge of forging and arcane tinkering sufficient to create a set of armor that augments and expands your abilities from a standard, nonmagical, set of heavy armor using resources you’ve gathered. This process takes 8 hours to complete, requiring the use of a forge, foundry or similar and it incorporates a Warplate Gauntlet (they do not require separate attunement). While wearing your armor, your Strength ability score increases by 2, and your maximum Strength ability score becomes 22.

##Body text
You can create a new set of armor by forging it from a set of gathered and purchased materials in a process that takes 2,000 gp and 8 hours. You can create multiple sets of armor, but you can only be attuned to one of them at a given time, and you can only change which one you are attuned to during a long rest. If you create a new set of Warsmith’s Armor, you can apply a number of Upgrades equal to the value on the class table, applying each at the level you get it on the class table.

##Body text
When you create your armor, you can create a heavy plated Warplate, medium balanced Wargear, light flexible Warsuits, or you can integrate your changes directly into your body as Integrated Armor. If your armor is Warplate or Integrated Armor, you gain the Powerful Build trait. Powerful Build means you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or left. Integrated Armor can’t be removed, but doesn’t confer any penalty when resting in it.

##Body text
Additionally, if you are Small, you become Medium while wearing Warplate.

Warsmiths & Magical Armor

##Body text
By the rules laid out here, using magical armor as a base for your Warsmith’s armor has no additional effect. This is intentionally the rules-as-written, but there is certainly some flexibility here.

##Bullet
 • Using Adamantine or Mithral, the properties carry over to the Warsmith’s armor.
##Bullet
 • Using +1/+2/+3 armor carries over, but counts as taking a free “Armor Class” upgrade for each +1 the armor has, meaning that upgrade can’t be taken to make the armor +4 or better.
##Bullet
 • Armor of Resistance carries over, counting as taking “Resistance” upgrade for that damage type for free.

##Body text
Other cases can be handled on a case-by-case basis. Consult with your GM and work something out that would be reasonable to combine making receiving magic armor a cool bonus, but not something that breaks the game!

What Does Your Armor Look Like?

##Body text
Nothing in this document specifies the visual appearance of your armor beyond the type of armor, but it very likely does not look like a standard set of armor. Consider what the visual differences are: Are your enhancements more mechanical in nature or more magical in nature? Does it have geared joints, glowing runes, or both? Consider how your setting might react to someone standing around in such armor. In all but the highest magical settings, such a set of armor is likely to attract some curiosity or concern.

Starting at 14th level, you’ve mastered the customization of your Warsmith’s armor. You can add one additional Upgrade to your armor that doesn’t count against your Upgrade total.

##Body text
Additionally, during a long rest, you can now swap out any one upgrade for any other upgrade of the same level, so long as you don’t have an Upgrade that requires the Upgrade you are removing as a prerequisite, or an incompatible Upgrade.

Force Blast 
##Body text
You upgrade your Warplate Gauntlet to deliver a special ranged attack. This attack is a ranged spell attack that deals 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier force damage, and has a range of 60 feet.

##Body text
You are proficient in this weapon. When you take the attack action, you can use this ranged spell attack in place of any attack made.

##Body text
Fortified Brace (Prerequisite: Warplate) 
##Body text
You build in systems to maximize defensive potential. As a reaction to taking damage, you can brace your armor, locking it in a defensive position. Until the start of your next turn, you gain resistance to all damage (Including the triggering damage) and any subsequent attacks made against you are made with disadvantage. On your next turn after taking this action, your speed is halved and you can’t take an action (you can still take a bonus action).

##Body text
Grappling Hook (Prerequisite: Warskin or Warsuit) 
##Body text
Your Warsuit gains an integrated grappling hook set into your gauntlet. As an attack or as an action, you may target a surface, object or creature within 20 feet. If the target is Small or smaller, you can make a Strength (Athletics) grappling check to pull it to you and grapple it. Alternatively, if the target is Medium or larger, you can choose to be pulled to it (this doesn’t grapple it). Opportunity attacks provoked by this movement are made with disadvantage.

##Body text
Grappling Reel (Prerequisite: Integrated Armor or Warplate) 
##Body text
Your Warsmith’s armor gains an integrated grappling reel set into your gauntlet. As an attack or as an action, you may target a surface, object or creature within 30 feet. If the target is Large or smaller, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check as if grappling normally to pull it to you and grapple it on success. Alternatively, if the target is Large or larger, you can choose to be pulled to it (this doesn’t grapple it). This movement provokes opportunity attacks as normal movement would.

##Body text
Iron Fortitude (Prerequisite: Integrated Armor) 
##Body text
You gain an unnatural durability. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is from a critical hit. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

##Body text
Lightning Channel 
##Body text
You are able to funnel your suit’s power into your attacks. You can use this upgrade to cast lightning charged* as a bonus action without expending a spell slot.

You create an artificial personality integrated into your armor, giving it limited sentience. This sentience assists you in many ways. While wearing your armor, your Intelligence ability score and maximum Intelligence ability score are increased by 2. Your armor can understand and speak any language you can speak. You can communicate telepathically with it while wearing it.

Talking Armor

How much of a personality Sentient Armor has is up to the player and GM. Functionally, it only enhances things that use Intelligence as written , but many people enjoy fleshing it out much further as a sentient item as a sort of NPC. This doesn’t extend what it does (unless the GM says it does, of course) but can be fun to interact with. It can be assumed to see what you see when you’re wearing it, but can’t provide assistance with ability checks without related upgrades.

The first time you use your Grappling Hook to move on a turn, the movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

##Heading 2
5TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

##Body text
Active Camouflage 
##Body text
As an action, you can activate active camouflage, causing your Warsmith’s Armor to automatically blend into its surroundings. This lasts until deactivated. While this is active, you are considered lightly obscured, and can hide from a creature even when they have a clear line of sight to you. Wisdom (Perception) checks to find you that rely on vision are made with disadvantage.

##Body text
Arcane Barrage 
##Body text
Your armor collects arcane energy whenever you expend a spell slot, storing a number of charges equal to the level of the spell cast. These charges fade after 1 minute if you do not expend additional spell slots. You can store a maximum number of charges equal to half your Inventor level. You can use this upgrade to cast magic missile without expending a spell slot. This expends all charges, increasing the level of the magic missile spell by one for each charge spent. If you have an Ether Reactor, you can expend charges from it to add additional charges, up to the maximum number of charges you can have stored.

##Body text
Once activated, it can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

##Body text
Artificial Guidance (Prerequisite: Sentient Armor) 
##Body text
You upgrade the artificial personality integrated into your armor to assist with a new skill. While able to communicate with your armor, you can gain the effect of guidance when making any Intelligence or Wisdom check.

##Body text
Emergency Protocol (Prerequisite: Sentient Armor) 
##Body text
The intelligence in your armor will attempt to preserve your life. If you are incapacitated or unconscious and can’t take your action, it will cast a spell or take the dodge action. It can only cast spells granted by your armor’s upgrades, and can use your spell slots to do so. It can act in this way up a number of turns equal to your Intelligence modifier, but this control strains its abilities, and it can’t take control again until you finish a short or long rest. You automatically resume control if you are no longer incapacitated or unconscious.

##Body text
Force Accumulator (Prerequisite: Force Blast)
##Body text
 Every time you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you accumulate charges to your Force Blast equal to the level of spell slot spent, up to a maximum number of charges equal to half of your Intelligence modifier (rounded down). When you deal damage with Force Blast, you can expend the accumulated charges to deal an extra 1d6 damage or to move the target 5 feet directly away from you, or any combination thereof per charge spent.

##Body text
Charges not expended within 1 minute of being accumulated are lost.

##Body text
Mechanical Enhancement (Prerequisite: Integrated Armor) 
##Body text
You improve every aspect of yourself ever so slightly. You gain +5 feet of movement, one additional hit point per Inventor level, and +1 to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws.

##Body text
Reactive Plating (Prerequisite: Warplate) 
##Body text
Your armor partially deflects incoming blows. You can use your reaction when hit by an attack that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage to reduce the damage of that attack by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.

##Body text
Resistance (You can apply this upgrade multiple times.) 
##Body text
You tune your armor against certain forms of damage. Choose acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, radiant, or thunder damage. While wearing your armor you have resistance to that type of damage. If you apply this upgrade more than once you must choose a different damage type.

##Body text
Sealed Suit (Prerequisite: Warplate) 
##Body text
As a bonus action on your turn you can environmentally seal your Warplate, giving you an air supply for up to 1 hour and making you immune to poison (but not curing you of existing poisoned conditions).

##Body text
In addition to the above, you are also considered acclimated to cold and hot climates while wearing your armor, and you’re also acclimated to high altitude while wearing your armor.

##Heading 2
9TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

##Body text
Assume Control (Prerequisite: Emergency Protocol) 
##Body text
You expand the control available to your armor’s sentience. You can set additional conditions when your armor will take control of your movement and actions, and it can maintain this control for up to 1 minute.

##Body text
While acting in this mode, it can take any action you could take (including attacking), but can only cast spells granted by Upgrades. It uses your ability scores.

##Body text
The triggering event can be a preset condition, a verbal command, or a specified time. Your armor is immune to the charmed, blinded, frightened, paralyzed, and poisoned conditions, and doesn’t suffer from exhaustion, ignoring these effects if you are under them.

##Body text
If you have Warplate, it can act in this way even when you are not wearing it (or are dead). When doing so, it uses the game statistics of animated armor with the following modifications: It has an intelligence of 12 and it can cast any spells that come from Upgrades with a DC equal to your spell save DC.

##Body text
This counts as a use of your Emergency Protocol, and it can’t control the armor again (in either way) until you finish a short or long rest.

##Body text
In non-combat situations in which you are not wearing your armor, your armor’s sentience can exert a lesser control of the armor to move it about and perform simple tasks. During this time it has the statistics of an unseen servant, though it looks like your suit of armor. Its ability to do this is not limited, but it takes 1 minute to assume this kind of control of your armor, and it can only do so while you are not wearing it. If reduced to zero hit points, the armor is incapacitated until you repair it during a long rest, but it can still serve as armor.

Optional Control

##Body text
With the Assume Control upgrade, the armor taking control on Emergency Protocol becomes optional, though if you do not choose for it to activate, it can’t activate later unless the condition was previously specified (e.g. “take control if I fail two death saving throws”).
### Layout: end frame

##Body text
Brute Force Style 
##Body text
The strength imparted by your armor gives the force of blows the devastating power of a more skilled combatant. You can select a Fighting Style from Duelist, Great Weapon Fighting, or Two-Weapon Fighting and gain the effect of that Fighting Style while wearing your armor.

##Body text
Ether Reactor 
##Body text
You construct an ether reactor that feeds your armor, powering its upgrades with arcane energy. The Ether Reactor has 6 charges, and can be used to power upgrades that cast spells, even upgrades that would normally only recharge after a rest can instead be cast by using charges, spending 1 charge per level of the spell you are casting. You can cast spells at a higher level by expending more charges. It regains all charges at the end of a long rest.

##Body text
If your Ether Reactor has no charges left, you can overdraw your Ether Reactor for one last burst of power, but your armor is temporarily immobilized and your speed while wearing your armor becomes zero for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell cast. Once you overdraw it, you can’t do this again until you finish a long rest.

##Body text
Head-Up Display (Prerequisite: Arcane Visor, Sentient Armor) 
##Body text
You can delegate displaying and tracking things in your sight to your Sentient armor, granting you the following benefits:

##Bullet
 • When a creature attempts to take the Hide action against you, you can make an active Wisdom (Perception) check to contest its Dexterity (Stealth) check as a reaction.
##Bullet
 • When making a Dexterity saving throw against an attack you can see, you can make an Intelligence saving throw instead.
##Bullet
 • When a creature hits you with a ranged attack roll, you can cast true strike as a reaction targeting that creature.

##Body text
Phase Suit (Prerequisite: Warskin or Warsuit) 
##Body text
You gain the ability to cast misty step and blink while wearing your Warsuit. Additionally, as an action, you can become intangible, and move through creatures or objects until the end of your turn. If you end your turn inside a creature or object, you are forced to the nearest unoccupied location, taking 2 force damage for each foot you are forced to move.

##Body text
Once you become intangible using this upgrade, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

##Body text
Recall 
##Body text
When not being worn you can hide your Warsmith’s Armor in a pocket dimension. As an action you can magically summon the armor and don it. You can use a bonus action to return the armor to the pocket dimension.

##Body text
While in the pocket dimension the armor can’t be affected by other abilities and can’t be interacted with in any way.

##Heading 2
11TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

##Body text
Cloaking Device (Prerequisite: Active Camouflage) 
##Body text
If you do not move during your turn with Active Camouflage engaged, you can use your reaction to take the Hide action using an Intelligence (Stealth) check. You make this check with disadvantage if you are within 5 feet of another creature or you attacked during your turn.

##Body text
You can overload your camouflage to cast greater invisibility without expending a spell slot.

##Body text
Once you do this, you can’t do this again until you finish a long rest.

##Body text
Flash Freeze Capacitor (Incompatible with other Capacitors) 
##Body text
You can store arcane energy, releasing it in a torrent of freezing energy. As an action, you can cast cone of cold without expending a spell slot or charges. The affected area becomes difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

##Body text
Once you use this upgrade, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

Flight 
##Body text
You integrate a magical propulsion system into your Warsmith’s armor. While wearing your Warsmith’s armor you have a magical flying speed of 30 feet.

##Body text
Integrated Attack (Prerequisite: Integrated Armor or Warplate; incompatible with Iron Grip) 
##Body text
You integrate a melee weapon into your Warsmith’s Armor. When you apply this upgrade you must have a weapon to integrate, and you must choose where on your armor the weapon is located. The weapon can’t have the heavy property. You are proficient with this weapon. As a bonus action you can activate the weapon.

##Body text
You must treat it as though you are wielding it with one hand, but you can’t be disarmed of it. Once activated, you can use this weapon when you take the attack action, and it doesn’t require the use of a hand or your Warplate Gauntlet. You can apply this upgrade multiple times, selecting a new weapon and new location on your armor to install it.

##Body text
When you activate your integrated weapon, you can immediately make one attack with it. While it is active, if you take the attack action on your turn, you can make an one additional weapon attack with your integrated weapon using your bonus action.

##Body text
Iron Muscle (Prerequisite: Integrated Armor or Warplate)

Lightning Rod (Prerequisite: Lightning Channel) 
##Body text
Whenever you cast lightning charged* , you can treat the spell as if it was cast by a spell slot one level higher.

##Body text
Powered Charge 
##Body text
As an action, you activate a booster allowing you move up to 40 feet in a straight line. During this movement, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check to grapple any creature you would collide with (you still require a free hand to grapple a creature as normal; if you do not have a free hand, the check automatically fails and you collide with the target). On success, you do not stop and it is carried with you for the remaining distance or until your movement is stopped by a creature or wall.

##Body text
At the end of the movement, any creature you collided with or are grappling takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 5 feet you traveled. If your movement is stopped by a wall, and creature you are grappling must make Constitution saving throw. On failure, they are stunned until the end of their next turn.

##Body text
Once activated, it can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

##Body text
Power Slam Capacitor (Incompatible with other Capacitors)

Large Weapons

##Body text
How GMs handle large-sized weapons varies. Consult with your GM for the stats of a large weapon. Typically approaches are to either double the damage dice, or increase the damage by 1d4, but other approaches exist between the two.

Large Inconvenience 
##Body text
This is an optional route that can offer substantial benefits; it would generally be advisable to not pull punches on the drawbacks of being a Large-sized creature (difficulty gaining cover, in tight areas, etc). Discuss what sort of challenges you might face with this. Consider if a Piloted Golem—essentially a walking war tank—would have trouble interacting with things created for Medium-sized creatures: ladders, potion bottles, and more.

FLESHSMITH

##Body text
A Fleshsmith is a discomfiting presence in a group. Even when encountered in the most ideal circumstances, they simply have a lingering gaze that says "How could I improve that?" when they look at you.

##Body text
A Fleshsmith is a peculiar path of Inventor that has turned their creative talents... inward. They seek to understand and improve the limitations of flesh. All too frequently they place a slightly different value on aesthetics than others might, tending to find beauty primarily in efficiency.

##Body text
A Fleshsmith tends to be more eccentric than inclined to any particular alignment, though even the most benevolent ones may find that the only reason their activities wouldn’t be illegal is that no one considered them possible.

##Heading 2
FLESHSMITH'S PROFICIENCY

You can apply any upgrade you take to your Adorable Critter instead of yourself.

##Body text
As an action, you can cause your Adorable Critter to move up to 10 feet and take the Attack action (requiring no action from the familiar). Additionally, you can also do this as a bonus action a number of times equal to your Inventor level and you regain all uses at the end of a long rest.

When you select this thesis option, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and gain the Flaying Hook upgrade, and it doesn’t count against your upgrade total.

##Heading 2
UNRESTRICTED UPGRADES

##Body text
Acid Gland 
##Body text
Realizing that putting something that oozes acid inside yourself could not possibly go wrong, you do just that. As an action, or as an attack as part of the Attack action, you can spew acid, making a ranged spell attack against a target within 30 feet. On a hit, you deal 3d8 acid damage.

##Body text
Alternatively, as an action, or as an attack as part of the Attack action, you can spray all creatures in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d4 acid damage on failed save.

##Body text
Once you use either option, you can’t use this upgrade again until you finish a short or long rest. The damage increases by one die at 5th level (4d8 or 4d4), 11th level (5d8 or 5d4), and 17th level (6d8 or 6d4).

##Body text
Adorable Critter 
##Body text
You experiment on creating an adorable critter. You create— or modify—a Tiny CR 0 creature. This creature serves as a familiar as per the find familiar spell, but doesn’t disappear when reduced to zero hit points, and simply becomes unconscious. It can’t fully die unless destroyed. If it starts its turn unconscious, it regains its full hit points and regains consciousness. It can do this a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier.

##Body text
You can resuscitate it (or rebuild it, as necessary) at the end of a short or long rest should anything untoward happen to it without expending a spell slot or material component. Its creature type is construct.

##Body text
Better Eyes (You can select this upgrade multiple times.)

##Bullet
 • Darkvision (60 feet),
##Bullet

Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, or take 3d6 fire damage.

##Body text
Dissection 
##Body text
If you are holding a melee finesse weapon you have proficiency with, as an action you can make an Intelligence (Medicine) check against a creature within reach with a DC equal to its armor class. If you succeed on the check, you can deal damage to that creature equal to your weapon's damage dice plus your Intelligence modifier. On a roll of 20, treat the damage dice as you would on a critical hit.

##Body text
If you could normally make more than one weapon attack as part of the Attack action, you can deal a number of additional dice equal to the number of attacks you could normally make as part of an Attack action when taking this action (for example, if you have the Extra Attack feature and take this action with a dagger, you would deal 2d4 + your Intelligence modifier damage).

##Body text
Expertise to Hit

##Body text
Dissection can generate very high hit chance due to its nature, but deals less damage than attacking twice with Extra Attack would (as it only adds your modifier once), making it a trade off.

##Body text

##Body text
You don’t let things go once you have them in your grip. Creatures that are grappled or restrained by you have disadvantage on attempts to escape the condition.

Additionally, instead of attacking a target with it normally, as an action, you can spin the weapon wildly in giant deadly sweeps. Up to four creatures within 10 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. On failure they take damage equal to your weapon’s damage dice + your Strength modifier of your weapon’s damage type.

When you hit a target that is more than 5 feet away from you, if the target is Medium or smaller, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by its Strength (Athletics) to pull the target toward you. On a successful check, a Small or smaller target is pulled to you, and a Medium target is pulled half the distance (rounding up) toward you. The creature takes 1 additional damage for each 5 feet it is pulled.

##Body text
If the creature is Medium or larger, when you hit a target more than 5 feet away from you you can pull yourself up to 10 feet toward the target.

##Body text

If you are using a shield, you can apply the shield’s bonus as normal.

Vivisection (Prerequisite: Perfection of Mind) 
##Body text

If you kill a creature in this manner, you have advantage on a Medicine check to harvest organs, ingredients, or other items from it.

##Body text
Wings Seem Useful 
##Body text
You decide that wings seem useful, and install a pair on your back. You can shape them like any naturally functional wings, such as a bird, bat, or insect. These grant you a flying speed equal to your walking speed, so long as you are not wearing heavy armor.

15TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

##Body text
Adaptive Response 
##Body text
You attain full mastery of your body and its functionality, able to detect when it malfunctions. As a reaction to failing a saving throw against becoming blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, or infected by a disease as the result of failing a Constitution saving throw, you can end the effect, even if you would normally not be able to take reactions due to the effect.

##Body text
Once you do this, you can’t do this again until you finish a short or long rest.

CURSESMITH

##Body text
A Cursesmith’s power is invariably marked by the dark decisions they’ve made; some ignore this lingering darkness, pursuing the heights of power their reckless creation allows. Others leverage the twisted side effects themselves, believing there are no mistakes, only opportunities. Darker still are those that truly embrace the darkness of their twisted creations, becoming twisted creations themselves.

##Body text
A Cursesmith is not always evil, but they walk a path that dangles precariously over evil, making it an easy thing to fall into. They may be lawful, but the laws they respect are rarely those of normal mortal society that might get in the way of their dark delving.

##Heading 2
CURSESMITH'S PROFIENCY

##Body text
When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with one artisan’s tool of your choice, and learn one language of your choice from Infernal, Abyssal, Deepspeech, or Primordial.

##Body text
Additionally, you have advantage on any check to determine the nature of a curse.

##Heading 2
FORBIDDEN ARTIFACT

##Body text
At 1st level, you set yourself apart from other Inventors by seizing power that others dare not wield. You partake in a dark ritual investing enormous power and a part of your soul into a weapon. The weapon becomes permanently bound to you. You have proficiency with the weapon. If the weapon is lost or destroyed, you can reform it by drawing on its connection to your soul. This is a special ritual that takes 1 day, and summons the weapon to you if it was lost, or recreates it if it was destroyed.

##Body text
When you perform the rite, select two of the following upgrades: Empowered Artifact, Abhorrent Life, Grasping Form, Twisting Reach, Necrotic Wounding, or Eldritch Eruption. You can select additional properties as Upgrades, but your Forbidden Artifact can have a maximum number of these Upgrades equal to your proficiency bonus (meaning the first time you can select an additional property is 5th level).

##Body text
Abhorrent Life

##Body text
Your Forbidden Artifact takes a life of its own, writhing and lashing on its own at your mental direction. You can apply your Intelligence modifier to the attack and damage rolls of the weapon where you usually apply your Strength or Dexterity modifier.

##Body text
Eldritch Eruption

##Body text
You can release magical blasts of power from the weapon that deal damage equal to the weapon’s damage dice. Select from cold, fire, lightning or necrotic for its damage type when you select this upgrade. In place of making an attack with this weapon, you can release this energy as a ranged spell attack. The ranged spell attack has a range of 60 feet. You can apply your Intelligence modifier to damage done with this attack.

##Body text
Empowered Artifact

##Body text
The weapon hums with great power. When you roll damage with an attack made with the weapon, you can reroll one of the weapon’s damage dice.

##Body text
When attacking objects or structures, you can instead maximize its damage dice.

##Body text
Grasping Form

##Body text
Your Forbidden Artifact can twist around, binding targets. When you hit an attack with it, you can attempt to grapple the target as a bonus action. If you have the Abhorrent Life property, you can make an Intelligence (Athletics) check to initiate or sustain the grapple. You can’t attack other creatures while grappling a creature with this weapon.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Necrotic Rot

##Body text
The weapon is enshrouded in dark energy. Each time you hit a creature with it, it inflicts a stack of necrotic rot on the creature. At the end of that creature’s turn it takes 1d4 damage per stack of necrotic rot on it and makes a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, all stacks are removed. You can have a maximum number of stacks on a creature equal to your proficiency modifier.

##Body text
Twisting Reach

##Body text
If your Forbidden Artifact is a melee weapon stretches and flexes unnaturally in seeking its targets. Its range increases by 5 feet.

Tracking Necrotic Rot

##Body text
My favorite way to track this is just place the d4 next to the creature each time it gets a stack as it gives a great feeling of impending doom. If you have a less absurd collection of d4s on hand, simple tic marks can suffice.
### Layout: end frame

##Heading 2
SOUL INVESTITURE

##Body text
Due to your unique bond to your Forbidden Artifact, as a bonus action you can feed part of your soul into the weapon to empower it, weakening you and empowering it. While weakened in this way, you are under the effect of the bane spell. While empowered, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage on hit.

##Body text
You can make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw as an action to reclaim the invested soul, ending the investiture on success. If you finish a long rest while your soul is invested into the weapon, the number of Hit Dice you regain is halved.

##Body text
Drawbacks of Investiture 
##Body text
Soul Investiture is usually not a good idea, and forms only part of the power budget of the weapon. When interacting with various upgrades it can be quite powerful, but it is a risky and high-cost option.

##Heading 2
CURSED PATH

##Body text
Curse Bearer

##Body text
Your soul can carry great burdens. When you are under the effect of bane, you can choose to ignore the effect for a roll. Once you choose to ignore the effect, you can’t do so again until the start of your next turn.

##Body text
Additionally, when you suffer the effect of any curse from one of the upgrades granted by this class, you can suppress the effect, ignoring its negative consequences. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses on a long rest. If the curse is an ongoing effect, it is suppressed until the start of your next turn.

You can force your soul's burdens onto others. When you make an attack roll while under the effect of bane, if you hit the creature after rolling a 3 or 4 on the d4 from bane, the target suffers the effect of bane until the end of your next turn. This effect is extended to the end of your subsequent next turn if you hit them your Forbidden Artifact again while they are afflicted (regardless of the roll of the bane die)

##Body text
Additionally, when you suffer the effect of any curse of one of the upgrades granted by this class, as a reaction, you can force another creature within 30 feet to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or suffer the same effect. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses on a long rest.

Curse Eater

##Body text
You consume your Forbidden Artifact, destroying it and afflicting yourself with a terrible curse. You gain a melee natural weapon as the manifestation of this cursed power. On hit, this weapon deals 1d8 damage of your choice of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (selected when you gain this feature), and 1d4 necrotic damage. All effects that apply to a Forbidden Artifact apply to this natural weapon. You can apply Soul Investiture to this natural weapon.

##Body text
Additionally, you can absorb any item you create with this specialization, innately gaining its effect and curse. At the start of your turn while you are not incapacitated you gain temporary hit points equal to 1 + the number of cursed items you have consumed with this ability. If you are under the effect of bane, this becomes 1d4 + the number of cursed items you have consumed with this ability.

It can attack other creatures even while grappling or restraining a creature with the Grasping Form artifact property, but loses one damage die (starting with its smallest) for each creature it is grappling or restraining.

##Body text
Blood Rites 
##Body text
Delving your dark path, you formulate a way to form temporary containers of magical power using blood. Select three ritual spells from the Wizard spell list; you gain the ability to cast these spells as Ritual Spells. You can only take spells of a level you could normally cast at the level you take this Upgrade.

##Body text
To cast these spells as rituals, you require fresh blood; this can be provided by a creature that has been slain in the last hour, or by a creature (including yourself) providing it at a cost of 1d4 slashing damage (This damage can’t be reduced or prevented).

##Body text

Form of the Fiend 
##Body text
As an action, you can expend a spell slot to assume the form of a fiend from the following list. The transformation lasts for a number of rounds equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus and requires your concentration to maintain, as if concentrating on a spell, or until you drop to 0 hit points or die. The new form can be a fiend from the following table based on the level of spell slot spent. Your game statistics, excluding mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen fiend. You retain your alignment and personality.

##Body text
You assume the hit points of your new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.

##Body text
You do not gain any spells the form can cast, legendary actions, or legendary resistances it might have. Your gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

You make a magical item that consumes magic around you. You can activate the item, casting counterspell or dispel magic against a target within 15 feet of you. When you cancel a spell in this way, you can consume the spell to recover 1d4 hit points per level of the spell.

##Body text
Alternatively, if the spell would have had a non-instantaneous duration and would have affected a creature, you can transfer one spell to yourself.

Blood Cloak (You can only wear 1 cloak at a time.)
##Body text
Attunement, Cursed. 
##Body text
You forge a blood-red cloak that drinks blood to empower you. Unfortunately, mostly your blood. When you take damage from slashing or piercing damage while below half of your maximum hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage taken (after taking the damage). If you hit a creature while you have temporary hit points, you can expend them, adding them to your damage roll.

##Bullet

You can decrease your Charisma ability score by up to your proficiency bonus, increasing your Strength ability score by an amount equal to your decreased Charisma.

##Body text
Whenever you slay a creature of CR 1/4 or higher, you gain +1 current and maximum Strength ability score. Both of these effects fade after 1 minute without killing a creature.

Ghost Cloak (You can only wear 1 cloak at a time.)
##Body text
Attunement, Cursed. 
##Body text
You craft a cloak that chips away at your bonds to the material world around you. At the start of your turn while wearing the cloak, you can choose to slip those bonds entirely, stepping into the ethereal plane. Moving through creatures doesn’t impose a movement penalty, and you can move through objects up to 5 feet thick as difficult terrain. If you end your turn in another creature or object's space, you are moved to the nearest available space, taking 1d10 force damage per five feet moved.

##Body text
Once you activate this item, you can’t activate it again until you finish a short or long rest.

While you are shrouded in these flames, any creature within 5 feet of you that hits you with an attack takes 2d8 necrotic damage.

##Body text
Pandemic of Despair (Prerequisite: Curse Bringer) 
##Body text
If a target becomes affected by bane (either the spell or the effect from Curse Bringer) you can force a creature within 5 feet of it to make a Charisma saving throw against the same effect, repeating indefinitely as long as you are affecting any creature (besides yourself) with bane . If a target fails their save, they become affected by the same effect as the initial target.

##Body text
True Artifact 
##Body text
Long ago you forged great power; now you realize its full potential. Your cursed weapon becomes a true artifact. Any bonus to attack and damage rolls lower than +3 it has is replaced by a bonus of +3, and it gains two additional properties from the following list:

##Bullet
 • While attuned to this artifact, one of your ability scores (chosen when this upgrade is selected) increases by 1, to a maximum of 24.

RUNESMITH

##Body text
A Runesmith is an Inventor that has narrowed their focus to working a specific language of magic - powerful runes that can channel long lasting power. These runes come in many shapes and forms, the lore behind them from many sources.

##Body text
A Runesmith can be a knight, their runes splashed with gleaming power across their armor, or a scholar lending their power to their companions, marking potent runes on their weapons before standing back, or even a strange tattooed mystic, their runes tattooed across their very body.

##Body text
Runesmiths are not inherently good or evil, though their rigorous attention to detail and patience tend to make them more inclined to a lawful perspective.

##Heading 2
RUNESMITH PROFICIENCY

##Heading 2
RUNIC MARKS

##Body text
Starting at 1st level, you can mark magical runes, imbuing the things they are marked onto with magic. A rune can be marked on a weapon, on a suit of armor, a shield, or directly onto yourself, as a type of runic tattoo.

##Body text
The affected creature of a rune is the creature wielding the weapon or armor it is marked on, or you if the rune is directly marked on you. A weapon or set of armor can only bear one rune, but there is no limit to the number of runes that can be marked on a creature.

##Body text
If a rune is marked on a creature, select either the weapon effect (affecting its natural weapons or unarmed strikes) or armor effect (affecting its natural armor).

##Body text
You know the following runes, and can learn more from upgrades. You can mark your runes during a long rest, and can have two runes marked at a time, gaining the ability to have an additional rune marked at 3rd level (to three runes), 5th level (to four runes), and 14th level (to five runes). These last until you mark a new rune, with the oldest rune fading when you mark a new one after reaching your maximum number of runes. Upgrades that grant new runes do not increase this number, but only expand the range of runes you can mark.

##Body text
Runic Effects

##Body text
Each rune grants a passive ability based on what it is marked on that enhances the ability of what it is marked on, and has an active ability that can be activated by you as an action or in place of an attack as part of the Attack action while it is marked. A rune can only be activated in this way once per turn.

##Body text
You learn how to translate a spell you know with a range of self into a glyph that can be marked on a creature or piece of armor. As a special 1 minute ritual, you can cast a spell you know with a casting time of 1 action, casting the spell as normal. The spell doesn’t take immediate effect, but instead becomes imbued as a special glyph on a creature or armor you are touching. This glyph has no passive effect, but when activated with an action, it casts the stored spell, originating from the creature or armor marked with this glyph, and using your spellcasting ability, spell attack, and spell save DC.

##Body text
Alternatively, the creature marked with this glyph or wearing armor marked with this glyph that is aware of its presence can use this glyph to cast the spell marked within as if they cast the spell stored using a magical item.

PSION

##Body text
A huge orc flies across the room, smashing through tables and chairs before hitting the wall with a thunderous crash, collapsing dazed. A human, her eyes still glowing with unearthly power, tosses a few extra coins on the bar. “Sorry for the mess. If he wakes up, tell him to try picking on someone his own size next time.”

##Body text
The prisoner’s expression turns from defiant to puzzled as the interrogator asks no questions, merely stares at them silently. His puzzled expression turns worried as he finds himself, unbidden, recalling where he stashed the loot. “Under the stables behind the Rusty Hook Inn” the interrogator finally speaks, as the thief’s expression becomes terrified.

##Body text
“Ain’t you... cold or somethin’?” the dwarf asks the elf as they trudge through the snow, eying her simple robe and bare feet. “I just think ‘warm’” the elf replies with a distracted air. The dwarf snorts, a puff of chilled air. Typical elf nonsense. Except... they haven’t frozen to death yet. “Say... could you think some ‘warm’ this way?” the dwarf asks hopefully. To the dwarf’s surprise, the chill of the snow fades away completely. “That’s downright creepy... hey don’t stop now! Was jus’ sayin’ it was creepy.”

##Body text
Psions are those who have tapped into a special otherworldly force, with the ability to actualize the power of their mind to accomplish impossible feats. Reading minds, lifting vast weights, and transcending physical limitations, they tend to inspire awe and terror in equal measure.

##Body text
The exact nature of what psionic power is might be a question answered in your setting, or it might not be. Most view psionic power as coming from within, though other answers exist—anything from the leaking power of the realms beyond, to an alternate way to express magic, to an actualization of an individual’s will upon the world.

##Heading 2
POWERFUL MINDS

##Body text
Since a psion’s weapon is their mind, they are always a careless thought away from harming those around them. For a psion, the line between thinking and doing can be very thin, forcing them to keep their thoughts and emotions in check, lest their powers run amok. This leads to many of them developing odd behaviors or mannerisms to help them control their state of mind, frequently seeming quite eccentric to an outside observer.

##Body text
Consider how your psion keeps their powers in check, and how much their power bleeds into their everyday life. How reading minds may affect their body language or habits. Do they add wood to the campfire from the comfort of their bedroll, or do they restrain themselves from using their power for trivial matters lest they slip up?

##Heading 2
MISUNDERSTOOD POWER

##Body text
In a world of widespread magic, many will assume a psion to be a type of Sorcerer or Wizard, mistaking their powers for the common applications of magic. The common villager keeps only one mental category for the supernatural and creepy people that bend reality to their will. But even among magic users, a psion’s powers will frequently be found unnerving.

It is often those who do understand magic that find a psion’s abilities the most aberrant. A force that intersects the magical weave rather than obeys it, the nature of the power that the psion wields one can only contemplate with unease.

##Body text
Psionics & Magic

##Body text
The mechanical interactions between magic and psionics are covered in the Psionics feature but may vary depending on your GM and setting. Psionics are still an expression of the supernatural and may still be affected by effects that suppress magical effects but are often mysterious and baffling to those familiar with magic, being a more raw interaction of the mind and weave.

##Heading 2
CREATING A PSION

##Body text
When creating a psion, consider your character’s background. How did you become a psion? Were you born with latent powers? Or did something happen to you granting your powers? Or did you intentionally train yourself through rigorous mental exercise to leverage them? Consider how developing a rare and mysterious power would have affected your interactions with people.

##Body text
Consider what your purpose is with your newfound powers, or how you plan to use your powers. Do you intend to be taken for a Wizard casting magic, or are you freely open about being of a... different nature?

##Heading 2
QUICK BUILD

##Body text
You can make a psion quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose a background that lends itself to intelligence skills.

##Body text
 Hit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier
##Body text

##Body text
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

##Bullet
 • (a) a quarterstaff, (b) a dagger, or (c) a martial weapon (if proficient)
##Bullet
 • (a) leather armor or (b) scale mail (if proficient)
##Bullet
 • (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack

##Body text
If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 3d4 × 10 gp to buy your equipment.

##Heading 2
PSIONIC ARCHTYPE

##Body text
At 1st level, you pick the archetype of psion you embody, choosing from Awakened Mind, Unleashed Mind, Transcended Mind, Shaper’s Mind, Wandering Mind, or Consuming Mind, each of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level, and again at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

##Heading 2
PSIONICS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Psionic Disciplines

##Body text
You are granted access to a psionic discipline (such as Telepathy or Telekinesis) by your chosen archetype. A psionic discipline comes with a passive feature that expands your character’s capabilities and an active psionic power that can be modified and empowered with psi points. Additionally you can use your discipline in more detailed applications to recreate the effect of certain spells, listed at the end of the discipline description. At 3rd level you can select a second discipline, and 18th level you can select a 3rd discipline.

##Body text
Psionic powers are suppressed by antimagic fields and can be dispelled with dispel magic, but are only affected by counterspell if recreating the effect of a spell. Any check required to dispel magic, counterspell or to identify a spell being cast with psionics is made with disadvantage unless the caster also has the Psionics feature. The detect magic spell will detect the usage of psionics, but not their nature: it will show up as a mysterious untyped power, even if being used to generate the effect of a spell.

##Body text
When recreating a spell through a psionic effect (using a psionic discipline to cast the spell) the spell has no material or verbal components, but using any psionic ability requires somatic components and causes the psion to vibrantly glow with the otherworldly psionic energies they are controlling.

##Body text
Psi Points

##Body text
Starting at 1st level, you gain access to psi points used to fuel psionic discipline powers and effects. You have a number of psi points equal to your psion level, and you regain all spent points when you finish a short or long rest. You can spend a number of psi points equal to half your Psion level (rounded up) at a time. For example, if you’re a 5th-level Psion, you can spend 3 psi points on a psionic power or cast a spell with a cost of 3 psi points.

##Body text
Psionic Ability

##Body text
Psionic powers, Psionic Talents, and spells gained through this class use your psionic ability.

##Body text
Psionic ability save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

##Body text
Psionic ability attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
### Layout: end frame

##Heading 2
PSIONIC TALENTS

##Body text
Starting at 2nd level, you gain access to a psionic talent allowing you to further specialize. Pick two talents from the list of psionic talents presented at the end of the class description. You can pick a new psionic talent at 5th, 7th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level. When you level up, you can replace a psionic talent you have previously selected with a different option.

##Heading 2
SECOND DISCIPLINE

##Body text
When you reach 3rd level, you can select a second psionic discipline from the list of psionic disciplines. You can’t select a Discipline you already know. You gain all features of a psionic discipline when selecting it.

##Heading 2
ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

##Body text
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##Heading 2
PSIONIC MASTERY

##Body text
When you reach 5th level, you gain mastery of your psionic powers. At the start of your turn you get 1 free psi point. This can be spent to empower psionic disciplines, but not to recreate spells or fuel Psionic Talents. If you have any unspent free psi points granted by this feature left at the end of your turn, then they are lost.

##Body text
At 11th level, this is increased to 2 free psi points, and at 17th level, this is increased to 3. Points can be split between different abilities.

##Heading 2
INNATE PSIONICS

##Body text
At 11th level, you gain the ability to exert great feats of psionic power. Choose one 6th-level spell from the psion spell list as an innate ability. You can use this innate ability to cast that spell once. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher levels, you gain more innate abilities of your choice that can be used in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Innate Psionics when you finish a long rest.

##Body text
Innate Psionics are well beyond the normal scope of your powers and are not restricted by what disciplines you have. Unlike psionic disciplines, they require any component the spell requires.

##Heading 2
THIRD DISCIPLINE

##Body text
When you reach 18th level, you can select a third psionic discipline from the list of psionic disciplines. You can’t select a discipline you already know. You gain all features of a psionic discipline when selecting it.

##Heading 2
ASCENSION

##Body text
Starting at 20th level, if you die you can choose to become an incorporeal entity on the Border Ethereal at the spot you died in the Material Plane at the start of your next turn. This entity has the physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) and abilities of a ghost, but has your mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) and your psion class abilities.

##Body text
When you take this form your current and maximum hit points becomes that of the ghost while you are in the form, if you have less than 10 psi points when you would assume this form, you have 10 psi points. While in this form you can’t rest to regain spent abilities. If you exhaust all Psi Points or the ghost is destroyed, you die as a normal creature would.

##Bullet
 • Class: Psion

##Heading 2
AWAKENED MIND

##Body text
An Awakened Mind is a psion who had their psionic power awakened within them by an encounter, event, or circumstance. Perhaps their powers were latent or perhaps their destiny had been that of a normal creature until powers were suddenly thrust on them. Perhaps they brushed the realms beyond in a vivid dream, perhaps they wandered the Feywild and came back warped, perhaps they merely glimpsed the eyes of a creature that did not belong walking down the street.

##Body text
An awakening is often somewhat traumatic. Psions are not well understood and the first power they manifest—telepathy— is one of the most feared and shunned abilities.

##Body text
An Awakened can be either empathetic or cruel, good or evil. Knowing what is on the minds of others affects people in different ways, driving some away from society as they see its true face, while others feel drawn to help the problems only they can see.

##Heading 2
OPENED MIND

##Body text
At 1st level when you select this archetype, your mind awakens the ability to directly connect to the minds of other creatures, granting the psionic discipline of Telepathy.

##Heading 2
MENTAL AWARENESS

##Body text
Additionally, starting at 1st level, you can use Intelligence instead of Wisdom when making an Insight check against a creature with an Intelligence ability score of 6 or higher.

##Body text
Further, if you have telepathically communicated with a willing creature, you know their general location (direction and rough estimate of distance) for the next hour as long as you are on the same plane as them.

##Heading 2
MIND READER

##Body text
Starting at 3rd level, when you use Telepathic Intrusion, you can force the target to make an Intelligence saving throw instead of a Wisdom saving throw against the power (deciding when you use the ability).

##Body text
When a creature fails a saving throw against your Telepathic Intrusion, you gain a d4. Until the end of your next turn, if you make an attack roll against the creature or the creature makes a saving throw against one of your psionic powers other than Telepathic Intrusion, you can add or subtract the d4 from the roll (deciding to roll before you roll the attack or use the power).

##Heading 2
EMPOWERED PSIONICS

##Body text
Starting at 6th level, when you deal damage with a psionic discipline power you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage dealt.

##Heading 2
ALL SEEING EYE

##Body text
Starting at 10th level, you can see a creature by its mind. You gain a mindsight of 60 feet, allowing you to see creatures with an Intelligence of 6 or higher within range as if by blindsight. A creature you are unaware of can still be hidden from you, but you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier when making Perception checks to detect creatures.

##Heading 2
FULL AWAKENING

##Body text
Starting at 14th level, you can briefly fully awaken your expanded mind to true comprehension. At the start of your turn, you can expend 2 psi points to gain advantage on all saving throws and attack rolls until the start of your next turn.

##Bullet
 • Psionic Archtype: Awakened Mind

##Heading 2
UNLEASHED MIND

##Body text
An Unleashed Mind’s power is most often an innate force they struggle to understand or control, a reflection of their state of mind and mood projected onto the world around them, often to devastating results. The life of an Unleashed Psion is frequently their journey to control their unruly powers... or one of embracing the destructive powers fully.

##Body text
What the wellspring of their innate power is varies: they could be a psionic race, born under the influence of distant twisted powers, warped by fey blood, or a herald of something more sinister brushing against the material world. Sometimes their power will show itself in simple applications, but most often their power becomes known and feared when their temper flares.

##Body text
Their alignment frequently depends on the approach to their powers they have taken. An Unleashed Psion who emphasizes control and restraint, keeping their emotions from running wild and their powers from running rampant will most often be lawful, following strict personal codes. On the other hand, an Unleashed Psion who lets their power run rampant will almost always be chaotic in nature, acting on impulse... with great emphasis.

##Heading 2
UNSHACKLED POWER

##Body text
At 1st level when you select this archetype, you gain the ability to unleash your mind to physically interact with the world around you, granting you the psionic discipline of Telekinesis.

##Heading 2
OVERWHELMING POWER

##Body text
Additionally at 1st level, you gain the ability to cast thaumaturgy with your psionic powers. When you cast it in this way, you have an additional options:

##Bullet
 • You cause up to 10 pounds of loose objects within 10 feet of you to start floating for 1 minute.
##Bullet
 • You can force all targets within 5 feet to make a Strength saving throw, or be pushed 5 feet away from you.

##Heading 2
RAMPAGING POWER

##Body text
Starting at 3rd level, you gain a d4 rampage die. Once on each of your turns when making a damage roll, you can add this rampage die to the damage roll. If you dealt damage during your last turn, your rampage die becomes a d6, increasing with each subsequent turn you deal damage by one step, up to a d12; if you did not deal damage during your last turn or become incapacitated, it becomes a d4 once more. If you maintain a continuous d12 rampage die for more than one minute, you gain one level of exhaustion.

##Heading 2
EMPOWERED PSIONICS

##Body text
Starting at 6th level, when you deal damage with a psionic discipline power you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage dealt.

##Heading 2
UNCONTROLLABLE MIND

##Body text
Starting at 10th level, the strength of your rampaging mind is such that others’ attempts to control it are futile. You gain immunity to the charmed and frightened conditions, as well as effects that would control your mind while your rampage die is a d8 or more.

##Heading 2
UNSTOPPABLE RAMPAGE

##Body text
Starting at 14th level, when an attack reduces you to zero hit points, you can roll your rampage die. If your roll + your Constitution modifier is higher than the excess damage you took, you are instead reduced to one hit point. You can expend 2 psi points to roll an additional rampage die, adding it to the result.

##Bullet
 • Psionic Archtype: Unleashed Mind

##Heading 2
TRANSCENDED MIND

##Body text
A Transcended psion is most often one that has found their path to psionic powers through a mental epiphany, realizing the place of their mind within the multiverse and how it ties to everything else, seeing the keys and levers to the world laid out before them in their mind’s eye.

##Body text
Most often achieved either intentionally or accidentally through meditation and ritual, this can sometimes even be a passed on technique to reliably transcend the strictly material concerns, and explore the more cognitive realm and powers within.

##Body text
Transcended Psions tend to have the best grasp on their powers in control and principle, having come to understand the greater cosmos, but lack the reckless abandon some other Psions may have. Unfortunately less transcendent minds frequently cannot understand the greater truths they have learned and may view a Transcended Psion as a bit... peculiar.

##Heading 2
ENLIGHTENED

##Body text
At 1st level when you select this archetype, you gain the ability to empower your body with the power of your mind, granting you the psionic discipline of Enhancement.

##Heading 2
STATE OF MIND

##Body text
Additionally at 1st level, you can ignore the effects of extreme heat or cold, hold your breath twice as long as normal, and can go twice as long without eating or sleeping before suffering exhaustion.

##Heading 2
BALANCE OF POWER

##Body text
Starting at 3rd level, when you use a psionic ability (power or spell) to restore hit points or grant temporary hit points, you can add equivalent hit points granted to a stored pool. The maximum value of the pool is your psion level, and any points beyond the maximum are lost. The next time you make a damage roll, you can expend the pool to add damage equal to the stored value to one target affected by the damage roll. This stored damage is lost if not spent within 1 minute.

##Heading 2
PERFECTED ENHANCEMENT

##Body text
Starting at 6th level, when you grant temporary hit points with a psionic power you can add your proficiency bonus to the temporary hit points gained by one creature.

##Heading 2
MENTAL CONTROL

##Body text
Starting at 10th level, when you have to make a Constitution saving throw to avoid losing concentration on an effect from a psionic discipline, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the saving throw.

##Heading 2
MIND OVER MATTER

##Body text
Starting at 14th level, when you would roll a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you can expend 2 psi points to roll an Intelligence saving throw instead.

##Body text
Additionally, when you roll a Death saving throw, you can expend 4 psi points before rolling to treat the roll as 20.

##Bullet
 • Psionic Archtype: Transcended Mind

##Heading 2
SHAPER'S MIND

##Body text
A Shaper is a Psion that specializes in the materialization of their imagination, projecting it out into the world. No mere conjurers borrowing the powers of other planes, a Shaper manifests things from nothing but their own mind, weaving their creations into existence through the exertion of raw psionic power and imagination.

##Body text
A Shaper’s mind is a tool of nearly unrivaled power possessing both boundless creativity and inexorable will, but if that will is overrun, the world would do well to fear a Shaper’s nightmares.

##Heading 2
CREATOR’S MIND

##Body text
At 1st level when you select this Archetype, you gain the ability to will the contents of your mind into the world, granting you the psionic discipline of Projection.

##Heading 2
BOUNDLESS IMAGINATION

##Body text
Additionally at 1st level, when you conjure your Astral Construct, you can apply one of the following powers to it:

##Bullet
 • Devastating Weapons. You imagine more deadly armaments—from a greatsword to vicious fangs—causing your Astral Construct to grow more deadly. The Astral Construct’s damage becomes 1d12
##Bullet
 • Psionic Conduit. You can use your psionic powers, spells, talents through your Astral Construct, as if you were in its space.
##Bullet
 • Vivid Existence. Your Astral Construct fully materializes and automatically uses Solidify at the start of your turn without requiring a command to do so.

##Body text
You can change which benefit you grant it for the duration of the effect as a bonus action.

##Heading 2
ASTRAL METASTABILITY

##Body text
Starting at 3rd level, when you use your psionic powers to create an Astral Construct, it doesn’t require concentration to maintain, and lasts until dismissed, but you can’t summon another one while you have one summoned.

##Heading 2
EMPOWERED CONSTRUCT

##Body text
Starting at 6th level, when you deal damage with an Astral Construct or a weapon created by Project Item, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage dealt.

##Heading 2
ASTRAL GUARDIAN

##Body text
Starting at 10th level, when you would take damage while you have an Astral Construct within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to conjure it to you (sharing your space) and expend 1 psi point to Solidify it, transposing it between you and the source of damage. It takes the damage instead of you. If the attack deals more damage than it has hit points (from Solidify), you take the remainder of the damage.

##Heading 2
IMAGINARY ARMY

##Body text
Starting at 14th level, you can allow your mind to run wild, letting an astral army spring forth into reality. When you use Replicate, you can create one additional Astral Construct that can be controlled with the same action (commands still only affect one Astral Construct of your choice). This additional construct lasts until the start of your next turn and can’t be sustained. Once you create an additional duplicate, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

##Bullet
 • Psionic Archtype: Shaper's Mind

##Heading 2
WANDERING MIND

##Body text
A Wandering Mind is among the more mysterious incarnates of psions, these are individuals that just aren’t quite rooted in the same reality everyone else is... they find it more pliable and slippery, and prone to jumping right through it on occasion.

##Body text
How they get their powers varies. Some were born in the ethereal plane or went through a portal while young. Sometimes it is just that their mind just works along an axis most people cannot understand. No matter its source, they manifest a truly unique ability to treat certain aspects of the metaphysical with a certain mundanity, and are prone to treating their powers as absolutely natural things as one might treat an arm or leg.

##Heading 2
SPATIAL MANIPULATION

##Body text
At 1st level when you select this archetype, your mind grows a greater perspective on the nature of space and dimensions, allowing you to manipulate it and your relation to it, granting you the psionic discipline of Transposition.

##Body text
Additionally, your connection to your transdimensional powers are such that you can slide through the spaces you see in dimensions as another might slip through a tight space, without conscious thought or effort. You can use your Dexterity ability score in place of your Intelligence ability score calculating the DC or attack roll modifier of Transpositional powers, alternate effects, or talents that require the Transpositional discipline.

##Heading 2
NOMAD’S GEAR

##Body text
Additionally at 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and medium armor.

##Heading 2

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Starting at 3rd level, you gain the Rift Strike talent. If you already have the Rift Strike talent, you can gain one other Psionic Talent of your choice. The Rift Strike talent doesn’t count against your Psionic Talents known, but can’t be switched out on leveling up.

##Heading 2
CURIOUS MIND

##Body text
Starting at 3rd level, your wandering mind adapts to new situations constantly. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can select two skills you lack proficiency in. Until the end of your next long rest, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to ability checks made with those skills.

##Heading 2
PHASE DANCER

##Body text
Starting at 6th level, once per turn, you automatically gain one illusory duplicate as per the blurring modifier when you use your Phase Rift power. Additionally, your first attack roll before the end of your turn after using Phase Rift gains advantage.

##Heading 2
FLICKERING PRESENCE

##Body text
Starting at 10th level, your unspent Psionic Mastery points are not lost until the start of your next turn, but can only be used to cast flicker.

##Body text
Additionally, when you roll for the effect of flicker* or blink you can expend 1 psi point to reroll the result. You can select which of the two results you would like to use.

##Heading 2
PLANESWALKER

##Body text
Starting at 14th level, your understanding of how to traverse space expands to a previously incomprehensible scale. You gain the ability to cast plane shift and teleport . You can cast one of these spells per day once without expending a spell slot or use of Innate Psionics. Once you do this, you must finish a long rest before you can use them again, or use your 7th level or higher use of Innate Psionics instead of the spell selected for that level to cast these spells again before finishing a long rest. If you already have one of these spells selected for your 7th level Innate psionic power, you can select a new 7th-level spell from the psion list for that slot. Material components are still required for casting plane shift this way.

##Heading 2
WINDING PATHS

##Body text
Additionally at 14th level, your phase rift no longer has to go in a straight line, though it can only pass through a creature’s space once.

##Heading 2
ELEMENTAL POWER

##Body text

##Heading 2
PRIMORDIAL ASPECT

##Body text
Additionally at 1st level, as an action or when you deal fire, cold, or lightning damage (no action required), you take on an aspect of that element until the end of your next turn or until you take a new primordial aspect.

##Bullet
 • Cold. You gain an icy shell, reducing any nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage taken by your proficiency bonus.
##Bullet
 • Fire. You gain a fiery aura. Once per turn, a creature within 5 feet that hits you with a melee attack takes fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus.
##Bullet
 • Lightning. You flicker with lightning. Your walking speed is increased by 5 feet for the duration.

##Body text
You can additionally spend 1 psi point to gain resistance to the element to the start of your next turn. If you are specialized in an element, you can do this without spending a psi point for the element you are specialized in.

##Body text
Aspect Appearance

##Body text
The appearance of the aspect manifesting itself may vary, perhaps your hair becomes fire and radiates heat, or your skin takes on an icy sheen, but whatever the nature and consequence of the aspect is apparent to observers.

Controlled Power

##Body text
When you use a spell or power that targets an area, you can select a number of creatures equal to the psi points spent in the area of effect for the spell or power to be ignored. The power passes harmlessly around these creatures, they automatically succeed on their saving throw against the effect, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save against the effect.

When you use a power or spell that makes a ranged spell attack, you can convert it to a melee spell attack (such as forming it into a weapon shape), and when you would make an attack that would make a melee spell attack, you can instead form it into a shape and hurl it at a target within 15 feet making a ranged spell attack.

EMPOWERED PSIONICS

##Body text
Starting at 6th level, when you deal damage with a psionic discipline power you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage dealt.

##Heading 2
FULL MANIFESTATION

##Body text
Starting at 10th level, when you enter a primordial aspect, you can expend 1 psi point to fully manifest that element, replacing the primordial aspect with the following effect. If you are specialized in that element, it doesn’t require a psi point to fully manifest the power.

##Bullet
 • Cold. Your speed becomes 0 until the end of your next turn, but you have resistance to all damage types except fire and force.
##Bullet
 • Fire. Fire fills a 10-foot radius around you. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes fire damage equal to 1d4 + your proficiency bonus.
##Bullet
 • Lightning. You can use your movement to teleport a distance up to your speed for the duration.

##Body text
If you are not in a primordial aspect, you can fully manifest a power as a bonus action for 2 psi points (or 1 psi point if you are specialized in that power).

##Heading 2
ELEMENTAL FORM

##Body text
Starting at 14th level, you can expend 5 psi points to cast shapechange to assume elemental forms. When you cast shapechange in this way it has no verbal or material components, but you can only assume the form of a Water Elemental, Fire Elemental, or Air Elemental. If you are specialized in an element, the cost is reduced to 3 psi points, but you can only assume the form associated with your specialization (Water Elemental for cold, Fire Elemental for fire, or Air Elemental for lightning). A Water Elemental assumed with this form doesn’t have the Freeze property.

##Body text
Once you cast shapechange this way, you can’t do so until you finish a short or long rest.

 • Psionic Archtype: Elemental Mind

##Heading 2
CONSUMING MIND

##Body text
A Consuming Mind is a master of a dangerous branch of psionics, born from the ability to sap energy from other creatures. This power can tear away thoughts, minds, and ultimately vitality for the psion’s own consumption. A feared branch of psionics, it is sometimes believed to be one of the primeval roots of all psionic power, as it can be found among mind-eating monsters and ancient psionic space whales... which might have other names in various settings.

##Body text
It has been refined by those that seek greater power either from ambition or desperation, and unlocks a terrible but effective path. One example of mortal creatures walking this path are the houses of dark elves, who developed their dark powers from their study of feral, vampiric, brain-eating monsters.

##Heading 2
PSIONIC PREDATOR

##Body text
At 1st level when you select this archetype, you gain the ability to consume the psionic power of others. You gain the psionic discipline of Consumption.

##Heading 2
DARK LURKER

##Body text
Additionally at 1st level, your powers grant you intuition that allows you to better adapt and survive as a mind hunter. You gain proficiency in Stealth and Deception. If you are already proficient in either skill, you instead become proficient in a skill of your choice.

##Body text
When you use psionic abilities, you can make an Intelligence (Deception) check contested by a target’s Wisdom (Insight) to conceal your use of psionic powers from them, suppressing the ability’s usual visible indicators. If you spend psi points on the ability, you must subtract the psi points spent from your Intelligence (Deception) roll result (concealing greater uses of psionics being more difficult).

##Heading 2
RAVENOUS POWERS

##Body text
Starting at 3rd level, you gain the Psionic Talent Mind Devourer; this talent ignores the normal level restriction, and doesn’t count against your Psionic Talents known, but can’t be switched out on leveling up.

##Body text
Additionally, you can gain the benefit of this Talent from a range of 30 feet when the creature is killed by one of your psionic powers.

##Heading 2

SHATTERED HUSKS

##Body text
Starting at 14th level, your Mind Leech ability always gains the Shredding modifier, and it doesn’t cost a psi point to add the modifier.

##Body text
Further, you can use additional power to leave their mind further vulnerable. You can spend additional psi points on the Shredding modifier to further reduce their next Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw (up to 2 additional points to reduce it by a total of 3d4). Once this effect has been applied to a creature, you can’t spend additional psi points on the Shredding modifier against the creature until 1 hour has passed.

PROJECTION DISCIPLINE

##Body text
Projection is the ability to project what is in your mind to the outside world with your psionic power.

##Heading 2
PROJECT ITEM

##Body text
As an action, you can use your powers to project an inanimate object you imagine into your hands. It can’t be larger than 3 feet on any side or weigh more than 10 pounds, and is clearly ethereal in nature. The item behaves as a solid object. Weapons created with this feature deal force damage.

##Body text
Projected items fade after 1 minute, and you can have no more than 3 projected items at a time.

##Heading 2
ASTRAL CONSTRUCT

##Body text
Psionic Power

##Body text
Casting Time: 1 action 
##Body text
Range: 60 feet
##Body text
 Components: S
##Body text
 Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

##Body text
You project an ethereal creation from your mind at a space you can see within range, taking the shape of a Medium or smaller creature, weapon, or other object. This creation is clearly ethereal in nature. When you create it, and on subsequent turns using your action to mentally control it, you can move it up to 30 feet in any direction and attack, so long as it doesn’t move beyond the range of the power. To attack with it, make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage. If the Astral Construct moves out of range of the spell, it fades away into nothing, ending the spell.

##Body text
While the Astral Construct is active, you can spend psi points up to your per use limit to issue commands that affect and empower your construct. Commands require no action, but you can’t exceed your psi point limit in total commands issued, and each command can only be issued once per turn.

##Body text
Grab (1 psi point): Can only be used while your construct is Solidified. A target creature within 5 feet of your construct that is no more than one size larger than the construct must make a Strength saving throw or become restrained by the construct. At the end of each of the restrained creature’s turns it can repeat the saving throw. The condition ends if the construct becomes ethereal again, or becomes more than one size smaller than the target.

##Body text
Grow (1 psi point): Your construct increases by one size, and its number of damage dice increases by one. It returns to its normal size at the start of your next turn. It can only gain one additional die (for example, up to 2d8).

##Body text
Relocate (1 psi point): The construct disappears and reappears anywhere within 60 feet of you.

##Body text
Replicate (3 psi points): You use Relocate, but the original doesn’t disappear. Until the end of your turn, you have another construct and control both with the same action (commands only affect one of your choice). Pick one construct to fade at the start of your next turn or use Sustain.

##Body text
Solidify (1 psi point): Your construct becomes solid, blocking its space until the start of your next turn. You can only use this command if it is in an unoccupied space. It has an armor class of 16 and hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier + your psion level. The construct becomes ethereal again if it drops to zero hit points.

##Body text
Strike (2 psi points): The construct makes an attack (even if it has already attacked).

##Body text
Sustain (1+ psi points): At the start of your turn, you can sustain the effect of a Solidify, Grow or Replicate command for an additional round. An effect that has been replicated can be sustained across all replicated constructs with a single use, but each effect can only be sustained once per turn (for example, you can never sustain more than one replicated construct). This costs 1 psi point for each effect sustained. Sustaining Solidify refreshes the construct’s hit points to its maximum.

##Body text
Your telepathic insight allows to adapt and tailor your influence on others. When you make a Charisma check, after you roll but before you know the outcome, you can choose to roll an additional d20 and take the higher result. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses on a long rest.

##Body text
Empathy 
##Body text
You can psionically link yourself to other creatures. As a reaction to a creature you can see within 120 feet of you taking damage, you can grant them resistance to the damage taken, but you take psychic damage equal to the damage they take (after resistance). The damage you take can’t be reduced or prevented in any way.

##Body text
If the damage would inflict any further negative status effect on the target, you can choose for that effect to affect you instead.

##Body text
If you have any form of telepathic bond that allows long-distance telepathic communication affecting the creature taking this damage, the range is unlimited and you do not need to be able to see them.

##Body text
Mental Image 
##Body text
You gain the ability to use your Telepathy to project images into the minds of creatures with perfect clarity, interposing it over their reality. The spells silent image , major image , hallucinatory terrain , and seeming are added to your Telepathic Discipline Alternate Effects list costing psi points equal to their spell level.

Mental Influence 
##Body text
You specialize in the subtle touch, picking stray thoughts and soothing concerns without overtly intruding upon a mind.

##Body text
Reflected Agony 
##Body text
When a creature within 120 feet that you can see deals damage to you, you can use your reaction to spend 1 or more psi points (up to your psi limit) to share the pain you experienced back at them, dealing 1d10 psychic damage per point spent. The damage this deals can’t exceed the damage taken from the attack.

##Body text
Tactical Opening (Prerequisite: 5th-level Psion) 
##Body text
You can communicate the openings in a creature’s defenses to your allies. When a creature fails a saving throw against your Telepathic Intrusion, you can take the Help action targeting that creature as a bonus action, helping another creature that you can telepathically communicate with. When you take the Help action in this way, the range of it becomes 30 feet.

##Body text
Telepathic Link 
##Body text
Your Telepathic Communication gains an unlimited range as long as you have communicated with the creature within the last day, and the target willingly maintains the link. However, it takes an action to focus to communicate over distance if you can’t see the target (or for the target to communicate with you if they can’t see you). You can maintain a link with a number of people equal to your Intelligence modifier in this way. You can convey as much in a turn as you could by speaking normally.

PSIONIC TALENTS

##Body text
Astral Arms 
##Body text
As a bonus action, you can expend 1 psi point to create psionic constructions serving as additional appendages. These arms last for 10 minutes. You determine the arms’ appearance, and they vanish early if you are incapacitated or die. You can use the astral arms to make unarmed strikes. The unarmed strikes you make with the arms use your Intelligence modifier in place of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls. If you hit with one of them, you deal force damage equal to 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

##Body text
When you create them, or by spending 1 psi point as a bonus action while they are manifested, you can make a single unarmed strike with these arms as a bonus action. You can use Psionic Mastery points on this.

##Body text
Aura Sight 
##Body text
As an action, you can spend 1 psi point to psionically see the aura of a creature of your choice within 30 feet. When you see the creature’s aura in this way, you can determine if there are any spells or magical effects affecting the creature, and you learn their schools of magic, if any. You can also determine if the creature is under the influence of psionics. A shapeshifter or creature that is transformed or disguised by magical or nonmagical means must make a Charisma (Deception) check against your Psionics save DC. On a failure, you can perceive their original form in their aura.

##Body text
Awaken Mind (Prerequisite: 9th-level Psion) 
##Body text
You can cast awaken once without expending a spell slot or psi points.

##Body text
You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

##Body text
Beam of Annihilation (Prerequisite: 11th-level Psion, Elemental Mind subclass) 
##Body text
You gain the ability to cast a beam of annihilation* for 6 psi points. If you have a specialization of Psychokinesis, you can only select the related elemental damage type, but the beam’s damage ignores resistance to that damage type.

##Body text
Controlled Power 
##Body text
You gain the ability to suppress the glow and somatic component of your psionic powers. You can expend 2 psi points to use a power without a visual sign or somatic component. Each time you use this talent, the cost of doing so doubles until you finish a short or long rest.

##Body text
Divided Mind (Prerequisite: 9th-level Psion) 
##Body text
You learn the divide self* spell, and can cast it by expending 5 psi points. When you gain access to the Innate Psionics feature, you may expend a use of Innate Psionics to cast divide self* at the level of the use of Innate Psionics expended. For example, if you choose the teleport spell for your Innate Psionics feature at 13th level, you could expend a casting of teleport to instead cast divide self* as a 7th-level spell, and can’t cast teleport or divide self* as a 7th-level spell in this way until you finish a long rest.

##Body text
You do not require the material components of the spell when you cast it by expending psi points or a use of Innate Psionics.

##Body text
Dreamwalker (Prerequisite: 9th-level Psion) 
##Body text
You gain the ability to cast dream . You can cast the spell without expending a spell slot, but once cast, you can’t cast it again until you finish a long rest.

##Body text
Elemental Penetration (Prerequisite: Elemental Mind subclass) 
##Body text
When you use a psionic power or spell that deals cold, fire, or lightning damage, you can expend 1 psi point to make the power ignore resistance to that elemental damage type.

##Body text
If you have a specialization of Psychokinesis, if the target has immunity to the damage type chosen, this instead turns immunity into resistance for that power.

##Body text
You can spend psi points granted by Psionic Mastery on this ability.

##Body text
Empowered Strike (Prerequisite: Psychokinesis or Telekinetic Discipline) 
##Body text
Once per turn, as part of making a weapon attack as part of the Attack action, you can empower a melee weapon you are holding with psionic power. When you hit a creature with a weapon, you can apply Elemental Blast or Telekinetic Force modifiers (you can only select a power you know) to the attack (you can use Psionic Mastery on this). This doesn’t deal the base damage of the power, but any added damage causes the additional effects of the power to occur.

##Body text
When applying a modifier that would make it target an area of effect, only the target takes the weapon damage, but other creatures in the radius become a target of the attack as if using the power normally.

##Body text
Life Wielder (Prerequisite: Enhancement or Consumption) 
##Body text
You learn the spell invest life* . You can spend Psionic Mastery points to cast this spell.

##Body text
Mind Devourer (Prerequisite: 5th-level Psion) 
##Body text
You gain the ability to cast psychic drain* for 2 psi points. Additionally, whenever a creature within 10 feet of you with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher dies, you can expend your reaction to draw in its psionic power, regaining 1d4 hit points and 1 expended psi point.

##Body text
Mind Rider 
##Body text
As an action, you can touch a willing creature to see through its eyes and hear what it hears for the next hour, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the creature has.

##Body text
During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. You can end this effect at any time. While this is active, the creature has advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

##Body text
Perfect Focus (Prerequisite: 10th-level Psion) 
##Body text
You can enter a state of extreme focus. Your concentration is no longer interrupted by using a second ability that requires concentration, but your speed is reduced to 0 while concentrating on more than one effect; you have a -5 penalty to any Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. If you move or fail a save to maintain concentration, one of the spells you are concentrating on ends. If you fail the saving throw to maintain concentration by 5 or more, you lose concentration on both spells.

##Body text
Personal Truth 
##Body text
Your power of conviction allows you to believe what you choose to. If you spend at least one minute convincing yourself of something—no matter how absurd—spells and effects to determine if you are telling the truth will register that you believe what you have convinced yourself of.

##Body text
Additionally, your psionic powers allow you to impose your will upon reality to a certain extent. When you expend 1 psi point, you can perform a minor alteration to reality:

##Bullet
 • You can conjure any Tiny object you can imagine that is worth 1 sp or less. This creates an object as you envision it, but doesn’t grant you knowledge you do not otherwise have (for example, you would be unable to conjure a key to a lock unless you had a perfect mental image of the correct key).
##Bullet
 • As an action, you can change the color or taste of a Small or smaller object with 10 feet. This change lasts for 1 minute.
##Bullet
 • As a reaction to a creature within 30 feet taking damage (including yourself), you can change the damage type they take.

##Body text
Potent Psionics 
##Body text
When a target passes the saving throw against a damaging Psionic Power (granted by a psionic discipline), they still take half the damage, but suffer no other effects.

##Body text
Psi Crystal 
##Body text
You gain the ability to impart part of your mind into crystal. You can expend 2 psi points to cast the find familiar spell, but your familiar takes on the statics of a psi crystal (below) and the material component required is a crystal worth 10 gp instead of the normal material components. The Psi Crystal gains your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can use Psionic Disciplines with a range greater than self through your Psi Crystal as if you were standing in its location. If the psi crystal is destroyed, you gain its memories as your own. While you have a Psi Crystal active, as a bonus action, you can deactivate it to regain 2 expended psi points.

When you summon a Psi Crystal, you can store a fragment of your personality in it that you can then release by shattering the crystal. Select one of the following when summoning a psi crystal.

##Body text
Courage. When you make a saving throw against the frightened condition, you can use your reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion to gain advantage on the save.
##Body text
 Cowardice. When your Psi Crystal is within 30 of you and a creature comes within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion and immediately moving up to your speed away from the creature without taking any opportunity attacks.
##Body text
 Cruelty. When your Psi Crystal is within 30 feet of a creature that takes damage, you can use your reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion and causing the creature to take additional damage equal to your psion level.
##Body text
 Sympathy. When your Psi Crystal is within 30 feet of you and another creature, if that creature takes damage, you can use your reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion and granting the creature resistance to that damage. You take an equal amount of damage to the damage they take.

##Body text
Psionic Defenses 
##Body text
You gain a way to defend yourself using your psionic powers. While you are not wearing any armor or carrying a shield, your AC equals 13 + your Intelligence modifier.

##Body text
Psionic Weapon 
##Body text
As a bonus action, you can expend 1 psi point to imbue a weapon you are holding with psionic energy. For 1 minute, once per turn when you deal damage with that weapon, you can deal an extra 1d6 psychic damage.

##Body text
At higher levels you can expend additional psi points to further enhance the Psionic Weapon; 2 points to enhance it to 2d6 at 5th level, 3 points to enhance it to 3d6 at 11th level, and 4 points to enhance it to 4d6 at 17th level.

##Body text
Projected Nightmares (Prerequisite: Shaper’s Mind Subclass) 
##Body text
You gain an additional option for Boundless Imagination to apply to your Astral Construct:

##Bullet
 • Horrifying Nightmare: Creatures of your choice that start their turn within 5 feet of your Astral Construct must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Psionics DC or become frightened of your Astral Construct until the start of their next turn. On a successful save, they are immune to the effect for the next 24 hours or until you summon a new Astral Construct.

##Body text
Propelled Bound (Prerequisite: Telekinesis or Psychokinesis) 
##Body text
When you move on your turn, you can expend movement, up to your speed, in single bounding leap, propelled by telekinetic power or psychokinetic force.

##Body text
Schism (Prerequisite: 5th-level Psion) 
##Body text
You can spend 1 psi point to temporarily divide your mind to do two things at once until the end of your turn. While dividing your mind, if you use your action on a psionic power or spell granted by a Psionic Discipline, you can use your bonus action to use a psionic power that would normally take an action. The two powers share your per use psi point limit between them.

##Body text
Tantrum (Prerequisite: Unleashed Mind subclass) 
##Body text
Your anger boils just beneath the surface. When you roll initiative, you can instantly increase your rampage die by one step (from a d4 to a d6, for example). Additionally, if you take damage while your rampage die is a d6 or lower, your rampage die increases by one step.

##Body text
You telekinetically fling a weapon at a creature or object. Choose a weapon within 15 feet that isn’t being worn or carried, or choose a weapon under your control. Make a ranged spell attack. On hit the target takes damage equal to the weapon’s damage dice. The range of the attack decreases to 15 feet if the weapon has the heavy or special property, and increases to 60 feet if the weapon has the light property.

##Body text
You can use Psionic Mastery points on this power, and this power counts as a Discipline Power of the Telekinetic Discipline (for example, for the purpose of Empowered Psionics).

##Body text
You can spend psi points up to your per use limit to add the following modifiers to Telekinetic Weapons (you can add multiple modifiers). The points must be spent when choosing the target of the power.

##Body text
Multiple (1+ psi points): For each additional psi point spent, you can fling an additional weapon, making a separate attack and damage roll for each weapon flung.

Flinging Magic Weapons

##Body text
Strictly ruled-as-written, most magic weapon properties wouldn’t apply to Telekinetic Weapons, but personally I would grant a flung +1 weapon its +1 to attack and damage rolls. However, if you allow this, this should not be allowed to stack with any sort of focus or magic item that grants bonuses to spell attack rolls. Only one bonus should apply to a given roll.

##Body text
Keep in mind that there’s not inherently a way to get your weapon back, though you may be able to with other Psion abilities (such as Telekinetic Hands), so flinging magic weapons may not be an ideal tactic for longer ranges.

CLASS TOOLBOX

##Body text
The class toolbox is just what the title implies. It’s an expanded set of tools for Inventor and Psion that provide additional upgrades, talents, and more, as well as some tips and tricks to help you build your own content for the classes.

##Body text
The class toolbox is devided into two sections. First is optional variant options—additional subclass upgrades that represent ideas folks love, but aren’t suitable for all games in terms of balance or complexity. Some of these include the 19th-level upgrade series for Inventor, while others are upgrades that have large permenant effects on the character. These are optional content; they should always be considered to be at the discretion of the GM.

##Body text
The second section is my guidance on how to create your own additional content for the classes—guidelines that will help you think about making upgrades, talents, and more, and what sort of considerations they should take into account if you want to maintain a balanced game.

A special cannon made to devastate at close range. This weapon has a range of 30/90, but doesn’t suffer disadvantage when there is a creature within melee range of you. It deals 4d4 damage to targets within 10 feet, 3d4 damage to targets within 20 feet, 2d4 damage to targets within 30 feet, and 1d4 damage to targets beyond 30 feet. This weapon has advantage on targets within 10 feet of you so long as there is nothing between you and the target.

##Body text
This weapon must be reloaded with your bonus action once fired, and has disadvantage on all attacks if you have a Strength of 12 or less.

PSION CONTENT

##Body text
Like Inventor, Psion is nearly infinitely expandable. It can be expanded in Disciplines, Talents, Spells, and Feats. The toolbox will go over the creation rules of each of those in the next section, but as with the Inventor, this section will provide an example—something that is both content that can be used, and vehicle for discussing how extensions to the system work and what the considerations are.

##Heading 2
PSIONIC SYNTHESIS

##Body text
One of the ideas of psionics that has been presented several times through the iterations of the class, is the idea of seamlessly melding two Disciplines to create new effects. synthesized abilties. There are a few things that have to be considered here.

##Heading 2
THE ENTRY POINT

##Body text
The first question is, “How does this system unlock?” There are three obvious routes: this can be a new functionality to the system without any investment, this can be a new talent, or this can be a feat.

##Body text
Each presents a different budget for what this feature can do. If a feature doesn’t have any cost to unlock, it consequently shouldn’t have any added power. The trouble here is that new options almost inherently have added power, because flexibility is power. When there’s no investment into the system, you have no budget to work with, and consequently I wouldn’t recommend this route unless balance is not a strong consideration.

##Body text
A talent and feat both provide a barrier to entry—and a very similar one, but with some notable differences. A feat can grant a talent, and only grants one talent when it does, so they are very similar in power. The difference comes in opportunity cost and accessibility. A talent can be taken with little opportunity cost to the character, while a feat is much harder to take in most cases, and will consequently raise the level of Inventor investment needed to unlock these options.

##Body text
Generally, attaching an option to a feat will make fewer people engage with the system. However, this can make it a more unique decision point for the character, one that is entered with greater intentionality.

##Body text
We’ll make Psionic Synthesis a feat for this reason. It results in inherently more complicated characters, and consequently it is not a system I want characters to stumble into. It represents another level of mastery and understanding of the system; not one that makes you better or stronger than characters that don’t use it, but one that allows you to explore new concepts within the system

##Heading 2
PSIONIC SYNTHESIS

##Body text
Prerequisite: 4th-level Psion, 2 or more psionic disciplines known

##Body text
You gain the ability to meld your Psionic abilities together to produce potent new effects. When you select this feat, you can select one fusion talent for free. You can only select fusion talents when you have all the Disciplines in their prerequisite.

##Heading 2
FUSION TALENTS

##Body text
Here are some ideas for fusion talents that you might make available to a character. The power budget here is similar to what a feat would grant (since they had to take Psionic Synthesis to get access). More importantly, they try to provide a good answer for "If a character has both these disciplines, what are they trying to do?"

##Body text
Astral Rift (Prerequisite: Psionic Synthesis, Transposition Discipline, Projection Discipline, Astral Swap Talent) 
##Body text
As a bonus action, you can Phase Rift to where your Astral Construct is; this movement counts as a Phase Rift, and you can apply modifiers to it as normal. Your Astral Construct is moved to where you started this movement along the Phase Rift; during the movement you can command your Astral Construct to attack a creature it passes with its action.

##Body text
Elemental Phasing (Prerequisite: Psionic Synthesis, Psychokinetics Discipline, Transposition Discipline) 
##Body text
As you step between planes, you can tap into the Elemental Planes, bringing their power into the material with you. You can use Psychokinetic modifiers on Phase Rift (excluding Massive).

##Body text
Additionally, whenever you deal damage to an area with a Psychokinetics ability that would include yourself, you can phase yourself out of reality to take no damage from the effect.

##Body text
Kinetic Mastery (Prerequisite: Psionic Synthesis, Psychokinetics Discipline, Telekinesis Discipline) 
##Body text
Your ability to manipulate energy becomes a single blended prowess, freely swapping between manipulating force and energy. You can apply Telekinetic Force modifiers to Kinetic Blast and Elemental Blast modifiers to Telekinetic Force (though to do not gain any benefits from from a Specialization while doing so).

##Body text
Parasitic Nightmare (Prerequisite: Psionic Synthesis, Consumption Discipline, Telepathy Discipline) 
##Body text
You gain the ability to add Telepathic Intrusion modifiers to Mind Leech.

##Body text
Additionally, when you deal psychic damage to a creature that is frightened of you, you can render yourself invisible to that creature until the start of your next turn; you can immediately (no action required) roll an Intelligence (Stealth) check affecting only creatures you are invisible from as a result of this talent.

##Body text
If you are hidden from a creature that is frightened of you, when it moves, you can use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of that creature (at the completion of their movement).

##Body text
Phantom Blade Barrage (Prerequisite: Psionic Synthesis, Projected Weaponry, Telekinetic Weapons) 
##Body text
You can create a weapon with Projected Weapon as part of making an attack with it using Telekinetic Weapons, allowing you to project as many weapons in this manner as you make attacks (no additional action required). When you use weapons created by Projected Weaponry as the projectiles for your Telekinetic Weapons, the range you can fling the weapons is doubled.

##Body text
Additionally, if you expend 6 psi points on the Whirling modifier of Telekinetic Weapons, you can cast blade barrier instead of cloud of daggers , generating a much larger number of ethereal blades as part of the casting.

##Body text
Physical Telekinesis (Prerequisite: Psionic Synthesis, Enhancement Discipline, Telekinesis Discipline) 
##Body text
When you use an Enhancing Surge to empower a creature, you can expend a psi point to augment it with your Telekinesis to further assist them, optionally granting one of the following benefits:

##Bullet
 • You can move the creature 10 feet (this movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks).
##Bullet
 • You can telekinetically deflect the first weapon attack against them before the start of your next turn, giving that attack disadvantage.
##Bullet
 • You can telekinetically boost their next Strength (Athletics) check or weapon attack before the start of your next turn, granting that check or attack advantage.

##Body text
Addititionally, while under the effect of Enhancing Surge, the amount you can lift, drag, or carry is doubled with assistance of your telekinesis, and you can apply Telekinetic Force modifiers to your weapon attacks.

##Body text
Reality Warper (Prerequisite: Psionic Synthesis, Matter Made Real, Mental Image)
##Body text
 You can bring the illusions you make people see to life. When you are concentrating on an illusion spell, as a bonus action you can expend psi points during your turn to bring aspects of the illusion into reality. For each psi point spent you can bring a 5-foot-cube section of the illusion into reality until the start of your next turn, and it can have the following effects:

##Bullet
 • If the effect would do damage, each 5-foot cube can damage one target. That target must pass a Dexterity saving throw, or take damage equal to a number of d8 dice equal to the level of the spell.
##Bullet
 • If the effect would stop a creature, they can’t move through it. If the effect would restrain a creature, that creature must pass a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained until the start of your next turn.
##Bullet
 • Each 5-foot cube can affect only one creature that is either within it or adjacent to it. The GM may allow other effects at their discretion.

##Body text
The Void (Prerequisite: Psionic Synthesis, Consumption Discipline, Nullification Discipline) 
##Body text
You devour all supernatural effects near you. Whenever a creature (including yourself) within 5 feet of you takes damage from a magical source, you can expend 1 or more psi points to use your reaction to reduce the damage taken by 1d8 per psi point spent. You can divide this amount between multiple creatures within range if they take damage at the same time.

##Body text
Additionally, whenever you successfully cast counterspell , dispel magic , or remove curse , you regain hit points equal to the level of spell stopped or ended.

##Bullet
 • Feat: Psionic Synthesis (& Fusion Talents)

##Heading 2
REFLAVORING CONTENT

##Body text
Before we start building brand-new content, there’s another option to consider first: reflavoring content. This involves reskinning a feature, keeping its mechanics the same while changing the description to better fit your fiction. It provides an easier alternative: if all you’re changing is flavor and theme, you don’t have to worry about testing for balance nearly as much.

##Body text
This isn’t always possible—after all, this whole book exists because new options do extend the kinds of characters you can play. But it is always worth considering, and so I’ll walk through an example of a popular reflavored option during testing... the "Dragonsmith". This isn’t necessarily offered as a unique option for play, but to show how something can be built from reflavored elements to achieve a unique outcome.

##Heading 2
THE "DRAGONSMITH"

##Body text
Playing some form of dragon-inspired content is always popular, and this could be a candidate for some custom upgrades, but I’ve accomplished this by using upgrades largely already present. Let’s walk through how I’d build a Dragonsmith out of an inventor.

##Body text
First of all, we want to be as tanky as possible, and most of our upgrades are going to be about biting, breathing, or doing general dragon things.

##Body text
We’ll start with Fleshsmith. While it tends to be somewhat on the horrifying end in its default flavor, let’s look at what we can get from it, based on what we need.

##Bullet
 • A dragon must breathe fire. We can accomplish this with Brimstone Bladder , giving us a fairly serviceable dragon breath.
##Bullet
 • A dragon should bite and/or claw things. We have our choice here, but Extra Fangs is a good option for ensuring our chompers will be online. We can always pick up Extra Claws later.
##Bullet
 • We’d like some natural armor , though we can make do with regular armor. Subdermal Plating reflavored to scales can fit the bill.
##Bullet
 • We want some elemental damage on that bite. Fleshcrafted Enhancement with the Infernal Modifier on our Extra Fangs gives us just the fire damage we are looking for.

##Body text
We are only missing one iconic things: Wings. I would generally never recommend flight as a custom upgrade before level 11, and fortunately as level 11 rolls around, we can grab Wings Seem Useful to give us the dragon wings we were missing. Optional upgrades include Better Eyes to give you that draconic blindsight, the aforementioned Subdermal Plating, and we can give kick it up a notch with Massive Mutation giving us a "Dragonform"... it even has a built in "Frightful Presence"!

##Body text
This is absolutely not a bid to say you don’t need custom upgrades. This just shows an example of how you can adapt what is already there for the basis of your build. The class is highly modular, and consequently reflavoring can get you much further than it might with less modular content.

##Heading 2
BUILDING CUSTOM CONTENT

##Body text
Invariably no matter how many options are presented, the first thing people will want to do is make more. This is fine, and expected. I cannot give you a bulletproof way to make new content because it is an equation with infinite variables, but what this section will do is arm you with the best tools and advice I have for your endeavor in this effort!

##Heading 2
UPGRADES

##Body text
To speak generically about upgrades is challenging, but I can give some broad strokes of advice.

##Bullet
 • The easiest way to make a new upgrade is to look at another upgrade that does similar things, and adapt the logic and limitations of that upgrade to the new one you want to make. There’s one important caveat: if your upgrade provides a stacking bonus, make it mutually exclusive with other upgrades it might stack with.
##Bullet
 • As a rule of thumb, if it grants a 1st- or 2nd-level spell, the upgrade can grant a free use per short rest if that’s all the upgrade grants. The exception is spells of exceptional power that should be limited or avoided... the classic example of this being the shield spell. I generally do not recommend giving an upgrade that grants the shield spell.
##Bullet
 • Spells that grant 3rd-level spells or higher should never grant the spell at a level earlier than a full caster would get the spell. If the spell only grants a single spell, that can be granted at the level a full caster would get it, as a single use per long rest.
##Bullet
 • Upgrades that grant additional spell lists can grant a single use of its 1st-level spell, and scale to a single use of a 2nd-level spell at 5th level. They should not grant more than one spell per spell level.
##Bullet
 • Upgrades that grant static bonuses to rolls or armor class should be carefully considered. These can define builds, and should only play to the strengths of the subclass in a build-defining way.
##Bullet
 • Upgrades that do not grant damage or defenses typically have more freedom to be powerful. You can be generous with movement, particularly if it doesn’t ignore opportunity attacks, but you can reference the existing movement speed and movement upgrades for reference (Accelerated Movement, Grappling Hook, and Boots of Striding as some examples).
##Bullet
 • And finally for the Grand Secret . The key to balancing options is opportunity cost . Consider what they give up to take this upgrade, and if those things are of roughly equal value. An upgrade can only be made stronger by having a higher opportunity cost that is relevant to that character. Giving up heavy armor, for example, is not an opportunity cost to a Dexterity-based character, but giving up a flat amount of AC would be.

##Body text
Keeping those general guidelines in mind covers a surprisingly high number of the use cases. The game has infinite possibilities, but those possibilities generally fall into the categories above.

##Heading 2
TALENTS

##Body text
A lot of the guidance for upgrades is relevant to talents. If you skipped that section to get here, I’d recommend going back for it! But they do have some differences. The first and most important difference is that the budget for talents is lower than the budget for upgrades, and this has to be kept in mind. Talents also can be swapped out as you level for higher-level talents, so you cannot safely make new versions of high-level talents without removing existing ones (that are relevant to the character) from the pool of options.

##Body text
Here’s a list of the advice in broad strokes:

##Bullet
 • Talents should, by and large, not deal additional damage. They can give additional ways to deal damage, but should rarely increase the damage of things you are already doing, unless they are taking the place of a talent that deals damage, and are exclusive with it. If a character taking your talent is adding damage without removing it elsewhere, you should exercise caution.
##Bullet
 • Talents that break the rule above or otherwise provide a potent effect should take a bonus action to activate. The Psion has many potent bonus action uses, and this limitation can serve as a good opportunity cost to gate the combination of features.
##Bullet
 • Talents should generally not grant free uses of combat relevant spells, and if they do, should recharge on a long rest.
##Bullet
 • Talents that grant spells should either grant no more than two spells, or grant a thematic list of mixed combat value.
##Bullet
 • Psion is a short rest caster. Any effects that last more than 1 hour should be tightly curtailed or limited per long rest. For example, a talent should not grant the animate dead spell without limiting it to 1/long rest, and generally any healing effects should be similarly limited, if they go beyond the strength of cure wounds.

##Body text
These general guidelines cover most of the instances I can think of... and hopefully cover most of the instances you’ll think of, but there’s always room for more. Keeping these guidelines in mind, in particular the first one, will usually keep you fairly safe.

##Body text
The three limitations of Psions are short rest resources, bonus actions being tied to most of the potent effects, and, of course, limited talent selection. Keep these in mind and you should be fine to expand the tapestry into infinite possibility.

##Heading 2
DISCIPLINES

##Body text
This is where things get a bit more meaty, and is something I would recommend with caution. If you are creating a new Disicipline, you are engaging in a major undertaking, and taking balance into your own hands.

##Body text
But I’m happy to steer you the best you can, and consequently, I’ll give you the best advice I got in this endeavor, so you’ll at least be able to proceed with that!

##Bullet
 • All Disciplines are constructed in three parts: a minor passive feature that serves the function of a utility cantrip, a psionic power that serves the role of a flexible damage cantrip (with a list of modifications for spending psi points), and an alternate spell list. All three of these are balanced together.
##Bullet
 • The utility portion of the discipline should be more powerful and flexible than a typical utility cantrip. It often requires no action or replicates the effect of multiple cantrps, but as a rule, it should not deal damage, and should be tightly constrained to the concept of the discipline.
##Bullet
 • The psionic power of the discipline is the bulk of its power, and should be the thing you have in mind when setting out to make a Discipline. It should always take an action. If it deals damage, it should deal 1d8 or 1d10, and have a secondary effect, called a "rider effect". This can vary greatly, but if it deals damage it shouldn’t exceed a total damage of 1d12 without further investment. The rider effect should be consistently useful, but tied to the thing the power is doing.
##Bullet
 • The list of modifications should be phrased in such a way as to construct the name of the power, generally as prefixes to the power (for example the modifier "massive", building to "massive elemental blast").
##Bullet
 • There should be one option that scales the damage, such that if all psionic mastery points were used on that modifier, the damage of the power would scale the same way as a cantrip (i.e. 1d8 at level 1, 2d8 at level 5, etc).
##Bullet
 • Modifiers should be more expensive than a spell that costs the same number of points. Remember that (a) psionic mastery points can reduce the cost of these, and (b) that these are more action economy efficient than a spell, as you are still getting the basic effect of the power on top of the modifier effect.
##Bullet
 • Crowd control effects should cost as much as a spell that does that thing, but should not last more than 1 round, and should be used with some caution. For example, setting the cost of an ability that paralyzed at 2 points would be far too strong, despite the existence of hold person , even if the affect only lasted one round. An effect that paralyzed should cost 4–5 points, and be prohibitively expensive.
##Bullet
 • If the power targets weak saves (Strength, Intelligence, Charisma) its effects should be considered carefully. Powers uniquely can target weak saves, but that should be accounted for as part of the power budget.
##Bullet
 • The alternate spell list should include a mix of good spells and weak spells, but should generally not include shield.
##Bullet
 • If the power is exceptionally useful, the alternate effects should focus more on utility spells if possible.

##Body text
Hopefully this can serve as a basis on your journey for making a new discipline. It is a complicated endeavor, but taking it one step at a time, and comparing it to existing disciplines can get you pretty far.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Adding Inventors to your setting might be a large change... or it might be no change at all. Inventors and their inventions can be the herald of a new method of scientific and systematic thinking about magic into more organized and useful structures—the forebearers of a magi-tech revolution... or they might simply be an eccentric wizard with strange methods others find completely unreproducible.

##Body text
While Inventors are fully at home in any number of settings that end in the word "punk", they can also fit into almost any classical fantasy setting, simply with the assumption that their creations are ultimately fueled by their own power.

##Body text
All of which is to say that the impact of inventors in your setting comes down to the reproducible nature of their creations, and the default assumption is that their class features are not reproducible at all.

##Body text
What is more likely to have wide implications for a setting are the ways of thought of an Inventor, and this can make an interesting element or plot. What would the powers that be think of magical street lamps? Are magical streetlamps already widespread in your setting? Inventors are sometimes called an aspect of a "wide magic" (as opposed to a "high magic" vs. "low magic") dichotomy. They don’t bring higher magic to the table than a Wizard, but they are tied to the idea of "useable" magic.

##Body text
Here are some considerations a GM and Inventor can consider:

##Bullet
 • Are Inventors a recognized profession? Are they unique or rare, or is the setting in full swing of tinkering with the laws of nature through magic technology?
##Bullet
 • Are their goals focused purely on creating their own tools and maximizing their ability as an adventurer, or are they trying to create reproducible effects? This can often tie into the crafting system.
##Bullet
 • What do the systems of power in your setting (kingdoms, guilds, gods) think of invention? Is there a force that maintains the status quo?
##Bullet
 • Are their inventions the cutting edge of the setting? Are there guilds competing for who can make the biggest, baddest, thunder cannon?

##Body text
Inventors are not inherently different or disruptive—at the end of day they are just adventurers doing adventurer stuff. But they play to many themes that can have setting wide implications if that’s the route you want to go down.

##Body text
In many fantasy settings, there is the implication that there is a "grand age of magic" in history where magic items and things were made. An Inventor with these abilities may be someone that is delving into the ancient past, an inheritor of what once was. They might be the reason that assumption isn’t true in your setting. They might be why your setting is in a great age of magic right now, building airships powered by crystals or elementals or fiendishly complicated metal contraptions.

##Body text
As with many things, the best (and only) course of action is for the player and GM to discuss and align their expectations. It’s the GM’s world, and they may have put a lot of work into it! Consider what works best for the world, and what themes you want to play towards. An Inventor in your party can be a plot point... but it doesn’t have to be.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Psionics in your setting can be whatever you want them to be. They can be the same force as magic, or they can be something entirely different. Here’s what I generally assume them to be:

##Bullet
 • Psionics are supernatural powers that operate on the same mechanism and principles of magic, but is a different way to tap into and frame that power.
##Bullet
 • Psions draw their power from raw mental rigor that comes in different forms based on their subclass. It is a power that can be taught, but may rely on some underlying talent. While most similar to the powers of a Wizard, their structures of magic are internal, mental disciplines that are forged into their mind.
##Bullet
 • In my setting, the power behind ki and psionics is the same. They are powers of focus and mental discipline that manipulate the supernatural weave of the world.
##Bullet
 • They can be any of these in your setting, or none of these. The simplest and least impactful way to add psionics to a setting is to simply call it another way to use magic, and the system presented here supports that approach, but it also supports the extreme other end, while tending to assume something in the middle.

##Body text
Here are some considerations for how you might treat it, as well as how I answer these questions in my settings:

##Body text
Do Psionics work in areas that magic does not? Dead spots, antimagic zones, etc? 
##Body text
For my setting, they do not. It is far simpler to just transpose all the rules of magic onto psionics. The base game does not assume the existence of player-psionics, and consequently features like "magic resistance" do not mention psionics. If you would like psionics to be a completely different power, you can certainly allow them to not interact directly with magic, but it will require more work, as you’ll need to decide which creatures should have unique resistance to psionics, etc.

##Body text
Are Psionics widely recognized? Do people understand what they are? 
##Body text
This same question can be posed to magic in a setting. In my setting, magic is widely recognized, and most people understand it. Psionics are far more rare and considered aberrant abilities, but scholars, adventurers, and the well informed will recognize them... often with some wariness or superstition. Folks with an understanding of magic may treat psionics the same way mundane folks might treat those that use magic—with fascination and distrust.

##Body text
Is the Psion player character an anomaly? Is this a new outbreak of new powers that heralds the shifting of something beyond the material, or are they part of an ancient tradition? What is their place in the setting? 
##Body text
These are all really the same question. A psion in a setting can be the introduction of psionics, or they can be an odd curiosity, a unique magic user whose abilities work with a subtle difference.

##Body text
In my setting, psionics are an ancient power that predates the current systems of magic, introduced to mortal populations by interactions with ancient eldritch powers. These powers can be taught from preserved ancient traditions, or burst forth wildly from some new brush with the unknown. They are rare, but the level of rare to generate gossip, rumor, and curiosity. As with all things, set expectations with your player if their choices will draw them special attention.

Chapter 2: Subclasses

##Heading 2
PATH OF THE RAGING MIND

##Body text
The Path of the Raging Mind is a Barbarian that expresses their fury as a telekinetic manifestation. Their mind is so powerful that in their rage they warp the world around them. This is a psionic manifestation of a barbarian’s ability to focus their fury, and in battle this fury is weaponized as a deadly force that can fling about weapons and enemies alike.

##Body text
They have to struggle with control... until they unleash themselves upon the battlefield, wreaking havoc on all that stands in their way.

##Body text
Mental Strength

##Body text
This subclass often represents strength of mind, rather than raw brawn, but does not use Intelligence. This is because applications of your mental strength are generally via telekinesis, not academic application, and Strength continues to better mechanically represent how it functions. Consider if your character’s physical strength is more of a representation of their telekinetic abilities when using their Strength ability score.

##Body text
Even prior to taking this path, perhaps the character’s strength came from the instinctive use of their telekinesis at short range, only learning to manifest it beyond the range of their touch as they take this path.

##Body text
If you would like to play this as an Intelligence class, replacing all references to Strength with Intelligence, it doesn’t really break anything. Consult your GM.

##Heading 2
TELEKINETIC FURY

##Body text
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, when you enter a rage, you can telekinetically project your rage onto the world around you. All melee weapons gain a thrown 30/60 property for you. This range is reduced to 15/45 if the weapon has the heavy property and increased to 60/120 if the weapon has the light property.

##Body text
You can apply your Rage bonus damage to damage rolls made by thrown weapons, and can gain advantage from Reckless Attack on attacks made with thrown weapons.

##Body text
At the start of your turn while you are raging, you can call a number of weapons or Tiny objects equal to your proficiency bonus within 60 feet to you, as long as they are not being worn or carried. You call these to your hands or to telekinetically orbit around you until the end of your turn (after which they fall to the ground). Weapons telekinetically orbiting you can only be used when throwing that weapon. At the end of your turn (or if your rage ends) all orbiting weapons drop to the ground around you.

##Heading 2
DISTANT GRASP

##Body text
Additionally at 3rd level, you can manipulate small objects within 30 feet with your mind as if using your hand to interact with them, though you have disadvantage on any checks relating to Dexterity when doing so. You can use this power to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can’t Attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds in this manner. You can move an item you are controlling in this way up to 30 feet during your turn.

##Body text
While raging, the amount of pounds you can lift with this ability increases to 20 times your Barbarian level.

##Heading 2
FORCEFUL MIND

##Body text
Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to use the psionic power Telekinetic Force. The DC for your Telekinetic Force is 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. When you take the attack action, you can use Telekinetic Force in place of one attack. While you are raging, you can add your Strength modifier and Rage bonus damage to damage done with Telekinetic Force.

Additionally at 6th level, while you are raging, you and all allied creatures within 10 feet of you are considered to have half cover against ranged weapon attacks, as your telekinetic powers distort the area around you.

##Heading 2
COLLATERAL DAMAGE

##Body text
Starting at 10th level, when you use Reckless Attack with a thrown weapon, you can ricochet to try and hit a second target within 5 feet of the first. Use the lower of the two dice you rolled for the Reckless Attack as the attack roll against the second creature. If disadvantage would cancel out the advantage from Reckless Attack, you may not use this feature.

##Heading 2
FLING FOES

##Body text
Starting at 14th level, you become the epicenter of the battlefield, flinging targets about. When you hit a target with a weapon while raging, you may choose to knock them 5 feet directly away from you on hit. When you use Telekinetic Force while raging, you can always choose to apply the Hurling modifier (as if using 2 psi points), shoving the target an additional 20 feet in a direction of your choice.

##Body text
Additionally, all Medium and smaller objects and creatures that you are holding become improvised weapons for you, dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage, with the thrown 20/60 property. To throw an unwilling creature, you must have it grappled, and you can’t throw it beyond its normal range.

##Body text
Whenever you shove or throw a creature into another creature, both creatures take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

PATH OF THE EXOSUIT

##Body text
A truly unique Path, this is often defined by its exact nature, but such a nature varies widely. Perhaps it is a lost piece of technology, such as long dead Warsmith’s cast off armor that has developed strange properties, or perhaps it is an alien symbiote of some kind, with its own goal or objective (perhaps as simple as harmlessly feeding off your rage or your foes).

##Body text
You can select one of the options from the table below or work with your GM to make an entirely new concept. It can be biological or mechanical in nature, or could even be part of your race or origin. Perhaps it is something you find or something you make, but whatever its origin, it grants you terrifying capabilities on the battlefield.

Invention or Artifact?

##Body text
In general, this path represents a character coming into contact with a highly advanced and powerful exosuit. Increases in powers represent the character becoming proficient with its abilities, recovering them, or the character becoming strong enough to support those systems being used. Invention would typically be more represented by an Inventor Warsmith.

EXOSUIT

##Body text
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you become bonded to the exosuit, though you need not necessarily always be wearing it. You are permanently connected to it in some way, and even if it is lost or destroyed, it recovers itself through its bond to you.

##Body text
In its dormant state, it has a small collapsed form, recedes into your body, or has no form at all (based on its nature). When you enter a rage, it is activated, becoming a complete suit of armor. It subsumes whatever armor you are wearing when it activates, adopting the AC of that armor (if you are not wearing armor, it has the AC of your Unarmored Defense). In addition, it grants you the following properties:

##Bullet
 • Regenerating Armor. Your exosuit protects you from blows, reducing the damage you take by your proficiency bonus.
##Bullet
 • Iron Fists. If you are not carrying anything in your hand, that hand is treated as a weapon that deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage with the light property.
##Bullet
 • Smashing Force. Whenever you succeed on an Athletics (Strength) check to shove or grapple a creature, you can deal 1d4 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage to the target creature.

##Heading 2
POWER FIST

##Body text
Also at 6th level, when you make an attack roll with your Iron Fists, you can choose to forgo adding your proficiency bonus to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you can add double your Proficiency bonus to the damage roll.

##Body text
Additionally, your Iron Fists count as magical for the Purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Starting at 10th level, while you are raging, when you are moving a grappled creature, your speed is no longer halved.

##Heading 2

##Body text
Additionally at 10th level, once per turn during your turn, when you are moving a creature you have grappled, you can smash them into various features of the battlefield. If the grappled creature’s movement is stopped by colliding with a Large or larger object, a Small or larger creature, or immobile terrain, the grappled creature and the object it collides with both take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 15 feet you had moved prior to the collision.

##Body text
Some bards grow in talent, weaving beautiful ballads that move their listeners to tears. Some bards just turn up the volume. The College of Thunder is a path for those who want to be heard—to convey their message with great emphasis to as many people as possible. They often are keenly interested in innovating their instruments, finding new improvements that allow them to make new, louder, sounds... even if the musicality of those sounds is sometimes debated by more classical artists.

##Body text
Lacking in subtlety, these bards are viewed as innovators and pioneers by themselves... and generally a large pain in the ears by most others, especially their preceding generation.

##Heading 2
DRAMATIC CANTRIPS

At 3rd level, you become quite adept at getting loud. You learn the thaumaturgy and thunder noteK cantrips, which don’t count against the number of bard cantrips you know.

##Heading 2
HARSH CHORD

##Body text
Starting at 3rd level, as an action you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to play a powerful chord that sweeps outward. Each creature of your choice within 20 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes thunder damage equal to your bardic inspiration die + your bard level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells triggered by this damage are made with disadvantage.

While most clerics follow defined gods who seek to convert others to the cause, those of the Mystery Cults often intentionally obscure their faith with esoteric references and cloaked intentions. No less devoted than their more classically divine peers, they are not merely warlocks, but people of true faith in their dark and unknown deities.

Druids are often thought of as the guardians of the natural order and having a deep connection to the creatures of the land. Sometimes that connection goes horribly wrong. A druid of this circle has found their mind entangled with the horrors of the beyond, their natural connection to nature and its beasts becoming warped by the dark dreams.

##Body text
Druids of this circle may be haunted by the terrors they see, but many simply find their minds inoculated against the horror (perhaps by the touch of madness). Some even treat twisted abominations with the same care other druids might take to vicious and wild animals, treating them with pragmatic understanding and empathy.

Why limit yourself to what nature has provided you when you can supplement your combat superiority in unique and inventive ways that give you the edge? You build and innovate on the cutting edge... and use that edge to hew through your foes. There are few things more dangerous than weaponized creativity in the hands of someone that knows how to use it.

A Tech Knight could be called an inventor that opened the door of innovation, found the deadliest thing they could invent, and closed it once more, but that wouldn’t be accurate. They innovate continuously, improving their art, just with a highly specialized focus.

Chainblade. When you roll damage dice for this weapon, you can reroll as many damage dice as you would like once per attack, but you must use the new roll for any dice rolled this way. After hitting an attack with this weapon as part of the Attack action, if you have additional attacks you can make as part of the action, you can forgo them to deal an extra 4d4 slashing damage per attack forgone.

##Body text
Ramming Gauntlet. When you make an attack roll, you can choose to forgo adding your proficiency bonus to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the damage roll.

##Body text
Repeating Hand Crossbow. This weapon doesn’t require a free hand to load, as it has a built-in loader. Once per turn, if you make an attack with this weapon as part of the Attack action, if you do not have disadvantage on that attack, you can give yourself disadvantage to make a single additional weapon attack with this weapon as a bonus action (also with disadvantage).

##Body text
Ricocheting Weapon. When this weapon is thrown you can target two creatures within 10 feet of each other, using the same attack roll and damage roll for both targets; the damage dealt is halved for targets hit after the first. This weapon returns to your hand after you make an attack with it using the Thrown property. When you create this weapon, you can choose for it to deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.

##Body text
Transforming Weapon. When you gain this weapon, select 3 simple or martial weapons. This weapon can transform between any of those weapons as a bonus action. When you convert the weapon, it becomes overcharged with power, and the next time you roll damage with it before the end of your turn you deal an extra 1d4 lightning damage.

Rev Up

##Body text
When hit an attack with your Brutal Invention, you can overcharge with an effect based on your Brutal Invention selection, granting it an additional benefit:

##Bullet
 • Reckless Power (Chainblade): The weapon’s damage dice become d6’s for that attack (including the special property if activated).
##Bullet
 • Excessive Force (Ramming Gauntlet): The target is knocked 10 feet backwards.
##Bullet
 • Full Auto (Repeating Hand Crossbow): You immediately make a single additional attack as part of the same action, making the attack with disadvantage; this disadvantage can’t be canceled out.
##Bullet
 • Overcharge (Transforming Weapon): You deal an extra 2d4 lightning damage.
##Bullet
 • Hypervelocity (Ricocheting Weapon): The weapon can target creatures within20 feet of each other, and it can bounce to an additional target.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), regaining all uses on a short or long rest.

Additionally at 3rd level, over the course of a long rest, you can destroy a +1/+2/+3 magic weapon to transfer its bonus to attack and damage rolls to your Brutal Invention weapon.

##Bullet
 • Charged Armor. As a bonus action, you can juice your armor with power with the effect of the lightning charged* spell.
##Bullet
 • Rocket Boots. As a bonus action you can activate these to give yourself a jumping distance equal to your walking speed until the end of the turn. You take no fall damage from this movement, but creatures of your choice within 5 feet of where you land take 2d4 fire damage. Alternatively, you can use this to cast feather fall targeting only yourself.
##Bullet

WAY OF THE SOUL BLADE

##Body text
Monks of the Way of the Soul Blade are monks who have learned to harness and focus their ki, using their inner will and focus to control psionic powers—primarily into a blade of pure psionic power: a Soul Blade.

##Heading 2
SOUL BLADE

##Body text
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you’ve learned to focus your ki into a psionic blade. As a bonus action, you can create a blade of pure scintillating psionic energy. The blade you create this way most typically takes the form of a knife-like blade projecting from your fist, but you can shape it however you choose. You can choose to create multiple blades, but any blade you are not touching vanishes at the end of your turn and must be resummoned.

##Body text
Regardless of the form it takes, the weapon is a monk weapon for you, deals 1d8 psychic damage, and has the light, finesse, and thrown(20/60) properties.

##Heading 2
PSIONIC KI

##Body text
Additionally at 3rd level, you gain the Telekinetics Discipline; this can be found under the Psionic Disciplines list of the psion class. You can use ki points as psi points, with a limit of 1 ki point. This limit increases to 2 ki points at level 5, 3 ki points at level 9, 4 ki points at level 13, and 5 ki points at level 17. The DC for your psionic abilities is equal to your ki save DC.

##Body text
If your character has both psi points and ki points, those are added together into one pool and can be used interchangeably. Your psi limit (and the limit you can use ki points as psi points) becomes your psi limit + one third of your monk levels rounded down.

##Body text
When you use your action on a psionic power or to cast a spell using this feature, you can make one attack with an unarmed strike or monk weapon as a bonus action before the end of your turn.

##Heading 2
ART OF THE SOUL BLADE

##Body text
Starting at 6th level, your expertise with the blade allows you to control it in unique and powerful ways

##Heading 2
EXTENDED BLADE

##Body text
You can expend 1 ki point to give your Soul Blade the Reach property until the end of your turn.

##Heading 2
PSIONIC FLURRY

##Body text
When you make a Flurry of Blows, you can make the additional attacks with your Soul Blade.

##Heading 2
SOUL STRIKE

##Body text
When you take the Attack action, you use your soul blade to make a single piercing strike. Make a single attack using your action (forgoing any additional attacks gained from Extra Attack) to ignore all armor a creature has and treat its AC as 10 + its Dexterity. On a hit, the creature takes additional damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.

##Heading 2
POWER OF THE MIND

##Body text
Starting at 11th level, your psionic abilities manifest more completely, giving you greater control and power in your psionic abilities.

##Heading 2
ETHEREAL SWEEP

##Body text
When you use Extended Blade, you can sweep or stab through multiple creatures with a single blow. Once per turn, when you make an attack with your Soul Blade, if you have activated Extended Blade you can make a single additional weapon attack with your Soul Blade against a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier within range.

##Heading 2
CONSUMPTIVE BLADE

##Body text
Whenever you kill a creature with your Soul Blade that has an Intelligence of 6 or higher, you can use your reaction to draw in part of their psionic essence. You regain 1d4 hit points and 1 expended ki point.

##Heading 2
EMPOWERED DISCIPLINE

##Body text
When you use a Psionic Discipline, you can expend 1 ki point for free without exhausting the ki point on empowering the psionic power granted by the Discipline, even if you do not have any remaining ki (this can’t be used on the spells granted by the Discipline).

##Heading 2
TRANSCENDENT BLADE

##Body text
Starting at 17th level, your Soul Blade becomes a peerless weapon. You can add a +1 to its attack and damage rolls. You can choose for your blade to affect inanimate material, causing it to gain the Siege property and deal force damage to it when you choose. Reactions that parry or block to add Armor Class against an attack are ineffective against attacks made with the Soul Blade.

##Body text
Additionally, critical hits from your Soul Blade rend the soul of the target. If a creature would have less than 50 hit points after taking damage from your critical strike, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On failure, its Charisma score becomes zero and it dies.

OATH OF SANITY

##Body text
The following oath is a new subclass option for the Paladin, for those that wish to battle the psionic horrors from beyond.

##Heading 2
OATH OF SANITY

##Body text
The Oath of Sanity is the oath of someone that has survived exposure to the horrors that lay beyond the veil, or perhaps someone that has prepared for them through a mystical order, a forgotten tradition... or particularly vivid and over active imagination.

##Body text
While most who have glimpsed into the realms beyond suffer instant and irrevocable madness, these Paladins have glimpsed beyond and sworn to remain sane, no matter what the cost. They reject shielding their fragile mind from what they’ve seen in a comforting shroud of madness.

##Body text
An Oath of Sanity Paladin will usually seem to others as true neutral or lawful neutral following obscure codes incomprehensible to those who haven’t experienced a brush with the beyond, their morality coming in blue and orange rather than black and white. Almost universally they are dedicated to preventing the threats from beyond from consuming the material world and shattering the fragile minds within.

##Heading 2
TENETS OF SANITY

##Bullet
 • Order. Never act on random or chaotic impulses. These are the cracks of madness.
##Bullet
 • Vigilance. Never let your attention wander, lest you miss the signs of madness.
##Bullet
 • Discipline. Never indulge in a lapse of behavior, your habits keep you safe from madness.
##Bullet
 • Solemnity. Your work is terrible. Never take pleasure in it. That leads to the comfort of madness
##Bullet
 • Sanity. No matter what, never give into madness.

CHANNEL DIVINITY

##Body text
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

##Body text
Turn the Aberrant. As an action, you can make any aberration or undead, provided that it’s within 30 feet and that can see or hear you, make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

##Body text
If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.

##Body text
Deny the Supernatural. Immediately after you deal damage to a creature with your Divine Smite feature, you can use your Channel Divinity as a bonus action to attempt to strip the target of its powers. The target must make a Charisma saving throw or be unable to cast spells or use psionic abilities until the end of its next turn.

##Heading 2
ACTIVE MIND

##Body text
Beginning at 7th level, you can save against effects that allow you to save at the end of your turn at the start of your turn instead.

##Body text
Starting at 18th level, you can use your reaction to extend this benefit to another creature you can see within 30 feet that starts their turn under an effect they can save against at the end of their turn.

##Heading 2
CONSTANT VIGILANCE

##Body text
Starting at 15th level, you can no longer be surprised, and your passive perception remains the same even while unconscious so long as you have at least 1 hit point.

##Body text
Additionally, when you roll for initiative, if the total result of your roll is less than your passive perception, you can replace the result with your passive perception value.

##Heading 2
CLARITY OF PURPOSE

##Body text
At 20th level, as an action, you can fully perceive the world around you for what it is, shattering the foul magics that bind and piercing the veils that hide, unrelenting and focused, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:

##Bullet
 • You can gain truesight with a range of 120 feet.
##Bullet
 • You are immune to psychic damage.
##Bullet
 • You have advantage on saving throws against magical or psionic effects.
##Bullet
 • When you strike an enemy with a Divine Smite you can choose to cast dispel magic on the target as a bonus action without expending a spell slot. If the level of the spell slot spent on Divine Smite was higher than 3rd level, you cast dispel magic at the level of spell slot spent.

##Body text
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

Reaper vs Intrusion

##Body text
Psychic Reaper offers no saving throw, and consequently deals guaranteed damage in the cases you can use it. Telepathic Intrusion deals the same amount of damage and causes additional effects, but gives the target a saving throw. One is not always better than the other, though when spending psi points the Telepathic Intrusion can offer far more damage and utility at the corresponding higher risk that it might fail.

If the target is Small or smaller, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check to pull it to you and grapple it (automatically succeeding against objects that are not being worn or carried unless the GM sets a difficulty for a particularly complicated scenario).

##Body text
Alternatively, if the target is Medium or larger, you can choose to be pulled to it. This automatically succeeds, but this doesn’t grapple it, though if it is a surface or large object, you can choose to hold onto at the point you grappled if there is something to grab onto. Opportunity attacks provoked by this movement are made with disadvantage.

##Heading 2
PYROTECHNIC GADGETS

##Body text
Additionally at 3rd level, you gain access to an important arsenal of things that explode. Forgoing some subtlety for firepower, you gain the following options:

##Body text
Smoke Bomb. As an action, you can use this to cast fog cloud centered on yourself without expending a spell slot. It lasts a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier and doesn’t require concentration. When you cast fog cloud in this way, you can set the radius at 5, 10, 15, or 20 feet.

##Body text
Explosive Surprise. As an action you can toss explosives at a point within 30 feet. Creatures within 5 feet of the target point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Gadget DC or take thunder damage equal to your Sneak Attack damage. If you are hidden from a creature, it makes the Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage. This counts as dealing Sneak Attack damage and reveals your location if you are hidden.

##Body text
Shaped Charge. As an action, you can place a charge on an object, building or surface within 5 feet. At the start of your next turn, the charge detonates, dealing thunder damage equal to your Sneak Attack damage to the object, building or surface it was placed on, and half as much damage to any creature within 5 feet of it.

Unlimited Uses?

##Body text
Pyrotechnic Gadgets are balanced around the assumption of unlimited use and rogues typically speaking do not have rest gated resources, but practically speaking their supply is not truly infinite, just higher than generally makes sense to be worth tracking. If you would like a number to track, you can use proficiency bonus + Intelligence modifier uses of Pyrotechnic Gadget per short rest.

CLEVER INVENTIONS

##Body text
Starting at 9th level, you expand your selection. Select two of the following options:

##Body text
Gliding Cloak. You make a cloak that allows you to glide when falling. When you fall more than 10 feet and aren’t incapacitated, can spread this cloak to reduce your falling speed to 30 feet a round and take no falling damage. While falling in this manner toward the ground under normal gravity, you can move horizontally 2 feet for every 1 foot you descend.

##Body text
Mechanical Arm. You create a mechanical arm, giving you an extra hand. This mechanical arm only functions while it is mounted on gear you are wearing, but can be operated mentally without the need for your hands. This mechanical arm can serve any function a normal hand could, such as holding things, making attacks, and interacting with the environment, but it doesn’t grant you any additional actions.

##Body text
Mechanical Familiar. You can create the blueprint for a small mechanical creature. At the end of a long rest, you can choose to create a mechanical familiar based on it, and cast find familiar spell without expending a spell slot. The familiar’s type is Construct. This construct stays active until you deactivate it or it is destroyed. In either case, you can choose to reactivate it at the end of a long rest.

##Body text
Sight Lenses. You create a set of lenses you can integrate into a set of goggles, glasses, or other vision assistance that allow you to see through darkness and obscurement. You can see through fog, mist, smoke, clouds, and nonmagical darkness as normal sight up to 15 feet.

##Heading 2
AMONG THE BLASTS

##Body text

AETHER HEART

##Body text
Sorcerers of this origin are fueled by a deep connection to raw arcane energy, their soul touched by the raw stuff of the weave itself. Most of them don’t understand their connection to this power, but they can wield it with innate ease, manipulating magic by force of will alone.

##Body text
Sometimes this is artificial in nature—an ironwrought drawing power from their arcane heart, for example—while other times this marks an individual that was exposed to the raw essence of aether, becoming infused and intrinsically linked to it. They are characterized by an easy affinity of warping magic and ease of manipulating it in its raw and purest forms.

At 14th level, you gain immunity to force damage. When you would take force damage, you regain health equal to half the damage you would have taken. You can gain a maximum amount of hit points this way equal to your sorcerer level, after which you no longer gain additional hit points until you finish a short or long rest.

##Body text
Additionally, you learn the spell dispel magic , or another sorcerer spell of your choice if you already know it. Dispel magic doesn’t count against your spells known.

##Heading 2
OPENED MIND

##Body text
Starting at 1st level, your mind has interacted with something that is incompatible to a mortal understanding, forcing it to be opened and adapted to new ideas and powers. You gain the ability to communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language. That creature can reply in kind.

##Heading 2
PSYCHIC ONSLAUGHT

##Body text
Additionally at first level, when targeting a creature with a Warlock spell or attack roll, you can use your Telepathic Intrusion on them as a bonus action, assaulting them on both a physical and psychic level.

##Body text
You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses on a long rest. You can only use Telepathic Intrusion through this feature under the conditions it sets, unless you obtain it from another source.

##Heading 2
TELEPATHIC INTRUSION

##Body text
Psionic power

##Body text
Casting Time: 1 action
##Body text
 Range: 60 feet
##Body text
 Components: S Duration: Instantaneous

##Body text
You assault the mind of a creature you can see directly. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or take 1d8 psychic damage. If the target fails the saving throw, it has disadvantage on attacks made against you until the start of your next turn. You can choose to deal no damage to the creature when it fails its saving throw.

##Heading 2
GIBBERING TERROR

##Body text
Starting at 6th level, when you use the Telepathic Intrusion power, you always add the Terrifying modifier, causing the target to be frightened of you until the end of your next turn if it fails its saving throw.

##Body text
When they fail the saving throw by 5 or more, they additionally lose the ability to speak while frightened in this way, gibbering in fear in confusion.

##Heading 2
ALIEN MIND

##Body text
Additionally at 6th level, you have advantage on saving throws against being magically charmed or frightened.

##Heading 2
REBOUND INTRUSION

##Body text
Starting at 10th level, if a creature attempts to read your mind, you can make a Wisdom saving throw against the effect even if it would normally not allow a save. If it would normally allow a save, you have advantage on the save. If you succeed the save, you can instead read their mind, as if by the detect thoughts spell (this effect doesn’t require concentration, but lasts only until the end of your next turn, and targets only the creature that attempted to read your mind).

##Body text
Additionally, you gain resistance to psychic damage, and when a creature deals psychic damage to you, it takes an equal amount of psychic damage.

##Heading 2
UNLEASHED PSYCHE

##Body text
Starting at 14th level, you gain enough mental control to form the twisted nightmares that dwell within your mind into the world. As an action, targeting a point within 60 feet you spawn a malignant otherworldly nightmare, taking the form of a twisted aberration of terror.

##Body text
The first time a creature other than you is within 20 feet of it during their turn (including starting their turn there), they must make a Wisdom saving throw. On failure they take 4d8 psychic damage and become frightened of it.

##Body text
The spawned nightmare lasts until the start of your turn, when it fades away unless at least one creature has failed their saving throw against its effect, in which case it persists for another round (indefinitely until no creatures fail their saving throw against it, after which it fades away at the start of your next turn).

##Body text
Once you use this ability, you can’t do so until you finish a short or long rest.

THE THAT WHICH IS BEYOND INVOCATIONS

ORDER OF CREATION

##Body text
Wizards that belong to this order of thought seek to advance the application of magic through the merging of mechanical and magical pieces. They share much in common with Inventors in mind set, but delve deeper into the knowledge of magic, relying more heavily on it to power their mechanical inventions, and in turn creating mechanical inventions that more primarily serve to further their magic.

##Body text
They often seek to look beyond tradition and common knowledge, to seek out new spells and new ways of doing things. The value of new research and new technology is often more than dusty old tomes unless those dusty old tomes contain secrets of those who had reached the heights they seek in ages gone by.

##Heading 2
CRAFTING FUNDAMENTALS

##Body text
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in tinker’s tools.

##Heading 2
ARCANE AUTOMATON

##Body text
Starting at 2nd level, you apply your skills of magic and creation to forge a small mechanical helper. The find familiar spell is added to your spellbook. (If its there already add another 1st level Wizard spell of your choosing) Its material component becomes tinker’s tools (they are not consumed on casting), and when you summon it gains the traits for the creature selected, as well as the following additional traits:

##Bullet
 • Its type becomes construct.
##Bullet
 • It acts on your turn.
##Bullet
 • It gains temporary hit points when summoned or at the end of a long rest equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level.
##Bullet
 • As long as it is within 30 feet of you, you can cast spells as if you were in its position.
##Bullet
 • Select three wizard cantrips you can cast. Your familiar can cast these cantrips, casting them (in total) a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus (casting them as a 1st level caster). It uses your spellcasting ability modifier when casting these spells. It regains all uses when you finish a long rest.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Automaton Appearance

##Body text
Most arcane automatons look like a mechanical version of the creature selected for find familiar , but it can have any appearance as long as that appearance maintains the necessary configuration to have the traits it has (for example, some method of flying for flying familiars).

##Heading 2
ARCANE GADGET

##Body text
Additionally at 2nd level, when you prepare spells for the day, you can turn them into arcane gadgets. Select spells with a casting time of 1 action, 1 bonus action, or 1 reaction. These spells do not count against your spells prepared, but you build them into tiny gadgets. You expend the spell slot as normal for casting the spell, and can choose if you expend any material component with a gold piece cost to incorporate it into the gadget (if the material component is not consumed, it can be reclaimed after the gadget is used). Subsequently a creature holding the gadget can use the gadget to cast the spell; they do not require verbal or somatic components, but do require material components if they are not included in the gadget. The gadget loses its power if you use it to cast the spell, if you finish a long rest, or if you regain the spell slot expended to create it (such as with Arcane Recovery).

##Body text
You can prepare a number spell slot levels this way equal to your Intelligence modifier (for example, if your Intelligence modifier is +3, you could prepare three 1st-level spells or one 3rd-level spell in this way). Creatures other than you can use your arcane gadgets.

##Body text
Creatures that do so are treated as if they cast the spell though it uses your spellcasting modifiers and proficiency bonus. If the spell requires concentration, they must pass an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 10 + the spell’s level to cast the spell using the gadget. On a failure, the spell fizzles and is lost.

##Body text
Any spell cast by the gadget ends when the wizard recovers the spell slot spent to create the arcane gadget.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

##Heading 2
IMBUED GEAR

##Body text
Starting at 6th level, select a 1st- or 2nd-level wizard spell, and forge it into a magical item. You can cast this spell once without expending a spell slot, regaining the ability to cast it again when you finish a long rest.

##Body text
If the spell targets only you, has a duration of more than 10 minutes, and doesn’t require concentration, it lasts until you finish a long rest instead of its normal duration.

##Heading 2
REVERSE ENGINEER

##Body text
Additionally at 6th level, you gain the ability to reverse engineer the arcane magic of magic items. You can learn a spell from a magic item that can cast a Wizard spell as you would from a scroll, though the magic item is not destroyed in the process.

##Heading 2
CLEVER CREATION

##Body text
Starting at 10th level, your Arcane Automaton gains proficiency in two skills of your choice and can activate spells imbued in Arcane Gadgets without making an Intelligence (Arcana) check as long as the spell doesn’t require concentration. You can change what skills your familiar is proficient in when you summon it with find familiar again.

##Heading 2
CREATOR’S VISION

##Body text
Starting at 14th level, you can forge your Arcane Automation into new forms limited only by your creative vision. Select two of the following additional properties for it:

##Bullet
 • It becomes Medium or Large (your choice).
##Bullet
 • It gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed (if it doesn’t already have one).
##Bullet
 • It gains additional temporary hit points at the end of a long rest or when summoned equal to Wizard level (giving it combined total hit points equal to twice your Wizard level).
##Bullet
 • It can cast its cantrips as a 5th level caster, and regains half the uses of its cantrip casting when you use your Arcane Recovery feature.
##Bullet
 • It can cast a spell from an Arcane Gadget without making an Intelligence (Arcana) check even if the spell requires concentration, as long as the spell is 2nd level or lower.

##Body text
You can select the same properties or new properties to replace them when you summon your familiar again with find familiar.

MULTICLASSING

##Body text
As should be apparent, many of these subclasses are built around the themes introduced by the Inventor and Psion class in Chapter 1. They are intended to be fully standalone, but as with all things, it’s likely that players will want to mix and match. I’m not going to try to define every interaction, simply offer the general guide that, where possible, things will probably be generally fine if they are allowed to interact as one would hope.

##Heading 2
UPGRADES AND UPGRADE-LIKE THINGS

##Body text
Many of the Inventor themed classes get things that are similar to upgrades, but gained through their features. Generally these features can be treated as a similar upgrade in most cases where it would matter.

##Body text
For example, a Techknight that wants a quick way to get a second Ramming Gauntlet might opt to take a level of Inventor and pick up a Power Fist from Warsmith. This level of mixing and matching will result in some situations where the power curve will be lightly modified, but rarely result in any long term imbalances.

##Body text
Likewise, if they had Arcane Retrofit from either class, I’d probably let them use that Arcane Retrofit on the similar item from the other class as well, even if they didn’t have the sufficient level of the other class.

##Body text
The main exception to this general rule is that I would generally recommend anything that stacks a flat bonus to be, at very least, treated with caution.

##Heading 2
PSI POINT INTERCHANGEABILITY

##Body text
All classes that use Psi Points and Ki assume that these points are interchangeable in terms of balance and multiclassing. This might not be the case in your setting if Ki is a significantly different power than Psionics, but it should be fine either way.

##Body text
Any time a subclass gets Psi Points, I would allow those to be used on Psion class features like normal. There are exceptions to this under the standard disclaimer of specifics. Psionic Mastery still only applies to psionic powers, and wouldn’t apply to features gained through other subclasses by default, unless they also have the psionic power tag.

ADAPTING IRONWROUGHT

##Body text
The Ironwrought are easy to adapt to many settings, though the nature of their origin may vary widely. Perhaps they are ancient relics of a magical empire recently unearthed or perhaps they were mass produced for a terrible war the world still remembers. Perhaps they are entirely unique hurled across time and space by forces unknown, and no one is more confused as to how they got there than the Ironwrought themselves.

##Body text
While their lore is easy to adapt, their thematic presence may not fit all games. At the end of the day they are a concept more akin to sci-fi than the most classical of fantasy, and while the lines blur, setting up a world and what is in it is always the domain of the GM.

ADAPTING FARLING

##Body text
Farlings will general find a home anywhere psionics and strange outer planes beyond can be found. Due to the chaotic warping nature of existence beyond the orderly planes, the possibilities of what they spawn is near endless, and consequently slotting one of these strange alien wanderers in tends to be an easy fit.

##Body text
They represent a more benign interaction with these planes than most creatures that hail from such twisting madness, and can make excellent vehicles of exposition about them... or perhaps not. They may only know first hand that such things are unknowable.

IRONWROUGHT

##Body text
The origins of Ironwrought are many and varied. They can be the artisanal masterpiece of a Golemsmith, or perhaps a relic of a mass production of an ancient lost civilization... or perhaps not-so-lost a civilization. Their source and purpose will vary greatly. Were they made with sapience in mind, or did they gain it later? Were they made for labor or war?

##Body text
Some Ironwrought will dwell on these questions and what it means for them to exist outside of the boundary of their original purpose, but many simply move on, acquiring new parameters to live their life from those they interact with, finding their purpose in life as any of their more fleshy counterparts might.

##Body text
How they are treated in society will vary based on how common they are. In settings where Ironwrought created for labor are common, they will generally be treated quite neutrally, while they may be treated with greater fear or concern if Ironwrought were primarily created as war machines, though in both cases they might be mistaken for their last sapient cousins.

##Heading 2
SELF AWARE

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
While most constructs are not truly self aware, an Ironwrought is a special case of a cosntruct that has attained a full degree of self-awareness... sometimes in a more rudimentary way, sometimes as self-aware as any human. How that occurred is often dependent on your origin. Here is a table of some origins of your self-awareness. You can roll on the following table, pick one that suits your character, or select a different reason entirely based on your game’s setting and character’s backstory.

PERSONALITY

##Body text
The personality of Ironwrought can vary greatly as their origins can vary greatly. In some cases they are humanoids that have been bound to an Ironwrought, melancholy about their new metalbound existence. Other times they have a pragmatic nature unconcerned with the unknowable trivialities, focused on the here and now. Ironwrought most frequently have pragmatic personalities that are inclined to logical outcomes. While as a sapient creature they are capable of understanding emotion, they may not fully experience it, or not let it affect them to the degree of the more easily influenced fleshy fellows.

Each of the Modular Design options has been coded as a "spell" with Ironwrought Modular Design noted as the source, and the chosen options can simply be dragged to the actions tab on the character sheet for reference.

##Heading 2
FARLING

##Body text
Farlings are a race that comes from beyond the material plane, though few are certain where. While humanoid in shape, they are immediately distinguished from mortal races. They have a slender build, large eyes, and tendrils in place of hair. Their strange nature and inherent psionic abilities make them easily feared, but they tend to be far more friendly to mortal races than most of that which comes from the beyond.

##Body text
Farlings tend to be blue to purple, but can be more exotic colors, or even have strange and exotic colorations and patterns in some cases. The nature and location of their creation results in little consistency of exact appearance, though they will often have some traits of their progenitor (such as sharing an eye or skin coloration).

##Heading 2
ADAPTABLE MIND

##Body text
Farlings are exceedingly adept at picking up social cues and cultural norms, and despite their strange appearance can easily fit into a tolerant society, but often maintain exceedingly strange senses of humor and behavior, fully aware of its oddity, sometimes even playing up their alien nature. They enjoy seeing the reactions of other creatures to strange circumstances, even if they have to cause those situations.

##Heading 2
MEMORY AND AGING

##Body text
Farlings age by gaining memories. They do not biologically age, but have the ability to make permanent crystalized memories, and age roughly one day each time they do. Young Farlings make these memories a dozen times a day, aging rapidly while absorbing new information at an incredible rate, while aging Farlings become more selective in what they choose to remember. If they do not commit some memory in this way, their memory tends to be still somewhat better than a human, but they view these memories as transient things that will be eventually forgotten.

##Heading 2
NATURE AND BIOLOGY

##Body text
Farlings do not have a gender, though those that travel among other races may associate with one. They have a generally androgynous and alien apparence. They are capable of forming strong emotional bonds, though some (particularly younger ones) will find the idea of gender and the associated customs hilarious (potentially inappropriately so based on the culture). Farlings that exist for hundreds of years and absorb thousands of memories can create a new Farling by traveling to realms of mind and thought where reality is more flexible, and psionically willing a new one into existence.

##Body text
A newly created Farling is often left to experience the world on their own shortly after the creation, left with associates or friends of its creator (that they have hopefully made arrangements with) who will then move on, seeking to let the new Farling develop on its own, often seeking to not influence their experiences more than necessary.

##Body text
Taking care of a young Farling can be exhausting due to the rampant curiosity and inquisitive nature rapidly consuming new experiences and memories, but their inquisitive nature causes them to age exceedingly quickly. A young Farling can fully absorb many memories a day, aging exceedingly fast. It is usually not long before they seek to wander broader environments, and set out into the world.

##Body text
Farlings are not aquatic, but are unusually suited to it, often finding water quite comfortable and are natural swimmers.

##Body text
Dark Reflection 
##Body text
Some Farlings become addicted to acquiring memories, and particularly savor those from other creatures. While a player character can only absorb memories from a willing creature, some stories tell of Farlings that have fallen into evil ways, ripping and devouring the memories from mortal creatures compulsively devouring their memories until nothing is left, savoring the exotic memories they discover.

FARLING NAMES

##Body text
Farling don’t have traditional names, identifying each other through psionic projections of certain thought patterns. Those that interact with members of other races will adopt an assumed name, running the gambit from common and boring to outlandish and absurd. Their name often reflects the culture they most interacted with when finding they needed a name that could be made with sounds.

##Body text
They rarely place great importance in their name, occasionally changing it or accepting a new nickname without much thought, as they don’t particularly associate the name with themselves; to them, that’s merely what people call them.

##Body text
As a farling, your character has the following traits.

##Body text
Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score, Wisdom score, and Charisma score all increase by 1.

##Body text
Age. A Farling ages by absorbing memories. Each time they permanently absorb a memory, they age roughly one day. A young Farling can absorb dozens of memories a day, aging rapidly. Once reaching adulthood (a process that often only takes a decade), the rate at which they can absorb memories begins to slow, they become more selective, aging far slower.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Old Age

##Body text

Alignment. Farlings show little consistency in alignment, and are shaped by their circumstances and background. Their curious and impulsive nature often leads younger members of the race to exhibit chaotic tendencies.

##Body text
Size. Most Farlings stand between 5 and 6 feet tall, with a slighter build than humans. Your size is Medium.

##Body text
Aberration. Your creature type is Aberration, rather than humanoid.

##Body text
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. You have a swimming speed of 20 feet.

##Body text
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common, Deep Speech, and one extra language of your choice.

##Body text
Adaptive Intuition. You gain proficiency in Insight, and have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine social cues or cultural customs.

##Body text
Psionic Mind. You gain the Telepathy Discipline of the psion, though you can’t use the Alternate Effects unless you gain this Discipline from another source. If you gain this Discipline from another source, you gain 1 additional psi point instead.

##Body text
Crystalized Memory. When you learn or experience something, you can fix that memory, making it a permanent memory you can always remember with crystal clarity. This memory can be anything that occurs within a 1 hour span (it can be as short as a fleeting sensation, or as long as 1 hour of events).

##Body text
Once you do this, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Absorbing these memories is how a Farling ages, and you age one day for each memory you absorb in this way. You can absorb a memory from a willing creature via your telepathy in this way.

##Body text
Broad Horizons. You have resistance to psychic damage. Once per day, if take psychic damage from a critical hit, you can choose to absorb that damage as a memory, taking no damage.

##Body text
Skill Absorption. Your rapid ability to learn new skills grants you proficiency in one artisan tool and one skill of your choice. At your GM’s discretion, if your game allows for the training in tools and skills, you may gain proficiency in them twice as fast using your Crystalized Memory feature daily.

##Heading 2
VARIANT FARLING

##Body text
At the discrection of your GM, the following is an intended feature of Farlings that can be added in place of Skill Absorption. This is a recommended feature to allow additional options, but may not be suited for all games due to interacterations with other custom rules at some tables:

##Body text
Alien Mind. When you gain the Spellcasting or Psionics ability from any class or feature, you can change the associated ability score to your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. Any time that class references the previous spell casting ability, you can replace it with your selected score (for example, if you are playing a Psion and change its associated ability score to Charisma, Empowered Psiosnics would add Charisma instead of Intelligence).

##Body text
Alien Possibilities

##Body text
This feature is very unique. It means that Farlings can play classes in new ways, and multiclass in ways that would not normally work, opening unique doors and possibilities that other races cannot share.

##Body text
If combining these rules with ones that allow for the relocation of ability scores, one should be careful to not unlock an option that may be unexpectedly potent. Work with your GM when combining homebrew and variant rules.

##Bullet
 • Race: Farling

##Body text
Fantasy Grounds Conversion Note

##Body text
The base Farling and the Variant Farling are coded into FG as subraces of the Farling. When this race is selected at character creation the player will be prompted to select either 'Farling' or 'Variant Farling' as their subrace. Selecting Farling gives the character the Skill Absorption trait, while selecting Variant Farling gives the character the Alien Possibilities trait. This is the only difference between the subraces.

##Heading 2
TEMPLATES

##Body text
The following are templates that can be placed over any race. These are not races, rather members of other races that have been defined by modifications that have been made to them. These templates can be treated as a modifier of a racial option. For example, one might refer to an elf using this template as an “augmented elf.” Though they superficially inherent the appearance of another race, all mechanical benefits of that race are replaced by the following properties.

##Body text
Consequently, you qualify for any feat or other requirement that applies to the base selected race, but all other bonuses are replaced by the listed bonuses for the class.

The augmented are creatures that have replaced parts of the body with mechanical and magical parts—some sort of an arcane cyborg.

These provide bonuses that replace or augment the default features of your race selection.

Augmented and Warped function as full races as far as FG is concerned. Short of creating an individual subrace for every potential combination of Augmented or Warped, there is no way to apply one of these "templates" over another race. The simplest way to make use of these races is to apply them as the character's race upon creation. Then drag the size, languages, and any other needed Traits from the 'Other' tab of the original race.

As an augmented, the following traits replace any traits that your race would normally grant you:

##Body text
Modified Origin. Select an existing race option. You gain the creature type, size, and languages of that race.

##Body text
Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1, and one ability score of your choice increases by 1.

Alignment. An augmented creature can be any alignment, but have a inclination toward lawful alignments.

##Body text
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

##Body text
Inherited Abilities. You can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it. Alternatively, you can forgo this to select two Augmented Abilities (below).

##Heading 2
AUGMENTED ABILITIES

##Body text
On top of your inherited abilities, you have been augmented with one of the following, granting you special new abilities:

##Bullet
 • Arcane Arm. Your arm is replaced by a mechanical or magical replacement. Your Strength score increases by 1, and it can serve as a natural weapon. It deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit, and counts as a simple weapon with the light property.
##Bullet
 • Arcane Eye. Your eye (one or both) are replaced by mechanical or magical replacements. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness as shades of gray, and gain proficiency in the Perception skill. You can cast the detect magic spell, and once you reach 5th level, the see invisible spell with this eye. Casting them in this way requires no material components. Once you cast either of these spells with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you have.
##Bullet
 • Arcane Heart. Your heart (or equivalent organ) is replaced by a mechanical or magical replacement. Your Constitution score increases by 1, and whenever you roll Hit Dice, you gain temporary hit points equal to the number of Hit Dice expended.
##Bullet
 • Arcane Mind. Your mind is enhanced by mechanical or magical minds. Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and you gain advantage on any Intelligence check to recall information you’ve seen before, solve mathematical equations, detect patterns, or break ciphers and codes.

##Bullet
 • Race: Augmented

Augmented presented unique coding challenges to make this dynamic racial template work within the confines of FG. Each of the four Augmented Abilities above is coded as a subrace, and one will be selected at character creation.

TWISTED ORIGIN

##Body text
Most often this comes from long exposure, sometimes only manifesting in creatures born under its influence, but there are those that have been warped later in life, generally by more direct interactions with the creatures that lurk beyond the veil of sanity.

##Body text
Many of the warped fall to madness, unable to escape the whispering voices and strange visions, but ones that become adventurers have managed to learn to live with their condition, and consequently have minds of steel.

NPCS

##Body text
The following are templates for psion and inventor NPCs (Non-Player Characters). You can build NPCs using the Player Character rules, or you can use these templates for a quick and combat-ready version. Their abilities as presented here are streamlined to generally only the most relevant features, but you can add any abilities from the class mechanics that you see fit for that character or their usage in your story.

##Body text
The versions presented here tend to present a psion with only one psionic discipline for simplicity. It is likely many NPC psions simply only have one discipline, or you can add abilities from other templates to represent a mix-and-match.

Monster Statblock vs PC Character

##Body text
Sheet Some GMs always use simplified monster statblocks for NPCs, and that is definitely an option. Personally as a GM, I use monster statblocks for enemies and temporary allies, eventually converting them to PC-style stat blocks if they will be present for a long time or controlled by players.

MONSTER SECTION

##Body text
The following is a list of new monsters and NPCs. These are designed to fit a variety of roles and provide a diverse cast of new threats to challenge your players, but also to tie into the content and themes of the book.

##Body text
Some of these monsters are designed to be solo encounters. These monsters present a significant and multifaceted fight for their CR.

##Heading 2
SOLO THREATS (BY CR)

##Bullet
 • Adaptive Slime (CR 5)
##Bullet
 • Lurking Maw (CR 9)
##Bullet
 • Unearthed Destroyer (CR 13)
##Bullet
 • Ascendant Master (CR 16)
##Bullet
 • Clockwork Drake (CR 16)
##Bullet
 • Ancient Sentinel (CR 19)

##Body text
The rest of the monsters are intended to be encounter building tools. Some have easy combinations: for example, a Silver Guardian (CR 9), a handful of Silver Soldiers (CR 6), and a few Silver Sentries (CR 1) will build a challenging, dynamic, and thematic encounter, and can each stand on their own as a minor threat—just probably not a campaign “BBEG” encounter. Likewise, the Uncaged monsters or the whole writhing mass of eldritch horrors are designed to naturally work together in fun (and challenging) ways.

##Body text
Other instances provide simple, flexible tools that can be dropped into encounters. I particularly wanted to flesh out the roster of easy-to-use NPCs.

##Heading 2
DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

##Body text
These monsters are built to the CR specifications of the base game, but should generally be expected to punch slightly above their CR. This is because each monster tends to be designed with some degree of synergy inside its own skills that is not well represented by CR.

##Body text
While the solo monsters (listed above) endeavor to provide a handful of unique challenges across the fight, all the monsters aim to bring at least one memorable encounter to bear.

##Heading 2
CLASS ABILITIES & PSIONICS

##Body text
The class abilities and psionics that appear in the monsters are simplified for convenience. Monsters use recharge mechanics rather than psi points, for example. This is merely to make running monsters easier. If you prefer to use psi points and more integrated class mechanics, you can generally treat a monster with psionics as a psion of a level equal to its CR, and with psi points to match. This will make monsters stronger than intended, but not by a large margin.

ANCIENT SENTINEL

##Body text
Legend speaks of ancient constructs built to hold back a terrible calamity of untold horrors from beyond. Posted as eternal guards over ancient lost portals, these construct sentinels were thought to be immune to whispers of madness that seeped through—a theory that has proved tragically misguided. Now twisted by the forces beyond, the sentinels have warped into eldritch engines of destruction, completely mad and not truly aware of their own actions.

##Body text
Awakening from ancient, forgotten sites, often long-lost vaults and shrines, these can appear without warning and wreak terrible destruction in a maddened rampage. These sentinels are massive creatures from an ancient era, towering 30 feet tall, and crushing anything built to a human scale with ease.

##Heading 2
DEPLOYMENT

##Body text
The ancient sentinel is intended primarily as a solo encounter, and particularly excels as an event. A rampaging, gigantic mechanical elephant is most dramatic when it has plenty of buildings—and maybe some villagers—to trample, and for the players to save. It is a siege monster that is exceptionally good at engaging many targets simultaneously. It can even enter a campaign a little earlier than its CR might suggest as a set piece encounter where the PCs are rallying a defense against it.

##Body text
If you do need some more chaos, you can have the ancient sentinel be the harbinger to a wave of psionic monsters that have broken through in its wake. Its immunity to psychic damage means it is largely unfazed by many of their effects, making this a devastating pairing.

##Heading 2
SIMPLE SCRIPT

##Body text
Here’s a simple script that you can follow to get an effective use from an ancient sentinel:

##Bullet
 • The sentinel should always move when able, ideally trampling any smaller creatures in its path and smashing buildings if possible. Move for maximum destruction unless it has a specific objective.
##Bullet
 • Move towards something that can be smashed.
##Bullet
 • During the advance, unleash a Bladed Trunk attack, moving the target into or out of its path.
##Bullet
 • Move through a target using Trampling Advance.
##Bullet
 • If it knocks a target prone or is moving through its last target, use its stomp attack.
##Bullet
 • Lastly, it should lash out with its tentacles against any target that is attacking it, either grabbing the attackers or flinging things at them.
##Bullet
 • If a target is bothering it with ranged attacks, it can fling creatures or objects it is grappling at the target.

##Heading 2
CONSIDERATIONS

##Body text
While the sentinel lacks ranged abilities, it can use Fling as a ranged offensive tool quite effectively, if needed, simply by picking up objects and throwing them. While its speed isn’t particularly high, its Unstoppable Advance trait and Unstoppable Trample legendary action mean its effective movement can be quite substantial.

##Body text
The sentinel may not care about the party at all. If they are insufficiently powerful to stop it, it may simply rampage through a city before wandering off to rampage elsewhere. Only if players prove a danger to it will it focus on them. While a very challenging monster, the dynamic nature of the fight will come from what the sentinel is destroying.

Traits
##Body text
Immutable Form. The sentinel is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
##Body text
Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the sentinel fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
##Body text
Magic Resistance. The sentinel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
##Body text
Scale Immunity. The sentinel has resistance to the damage of any spell that doesn't target an area of effect, and it suffers no other conditions or effects from them.
##Body text
Siege Monster. The sentinel deals double damage to objects and structures.
##Body text
Trampling Advance. Any Large or smaller creature in a space the sentinel passes through must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d12) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
##Body text
Unstoppable Advance. The sentinel's advance cannot be stopped. If the sentinel's speed would be reduced to zero, it is reduced to half its speed instead. Any obstacle or building that would stop its advance takes 39 (6d12) bludgeoning damage. The sentinel treats magical barriers that would stop its movement as difficult terrain.
##Body text
Whispering Madness. The sentinel is steeped in eldritch madness. If a creature starts its turn within 5 feet of the sentinel or while grappled by it, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (3d6) psychic damage and roll a d4, suffering an additional condition until the start of its next turn, as noted in the following table.

##Body text
Eruption of Corruption. If the sentinel is bloodied (reduced to less than half of its maximum hit points), it unleashes a psionic blast immediately (no action required), violently discharging the eldritch corruption within it. All creatures within 60 feet of it must make a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw. On failed save, a creature takes 21 (6d6) psychic damage and becomes stunned until the end of its next turn. On successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't stunned. The range of Whispering Madness then increases to 60 feet until the sentinel dies or recovers hit points above half its maximum.

##Body text
Actions
##Body text
Multiattack. The sentinel makes a bladed trunk attack, a stomp attack, and two tentacle attacks. It can replace each tentacle attack with one use of Fling.
##Body text
Bladed Trunk. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (3d12 + 8) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet in a direction of the sentinel's choice.
##Body text
Stomp. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (3d12 + 8) bludgeoning damage.
##Body text
Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The sentinel has four tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.
##Body text
Fling. One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the sentinel is thrown up to 60 feet in a direction of the sentinel's choice and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.

##Body text
Legendary Actions
##Body text
The sentinel can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The sentinel regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
##Body text
Tentacle Attack or Fling. The sentinel makes one tentacle attack or uses its Fling.
##Body text
Unstoppable Trample. The sentinel moves up to half its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

##Heading 2
CLOCKWORK DRAKE

##Body text
Clockwork drakes, sometimes improperly called clockwork dragons (or informally called “metal danger birbs”), are flying, metal constructs of intricate machinery and magic. Most often created by wizards or inventors, they have a distrust of other magic users, and the ability to nullify magic through blasts of their own power. Typically serving as guardians, seekers, or shock troops, many that exist now have long since outlived the creators that developed their esoteric behavior.

##Heading 2
SIMPLE SCRIPT

##Body text
This is a simple script to run a clockwork drake on:

##Bullet
 • If the drake can target 2 or more creatures with its breath weapon, it will use its breath weapon and then fly up 40 feet from the ground, if possible.
##Bullet
 • Between its turns, the drake will use its Arc legendary action if more than one creature is within range, and then its Wing Attack to position closer to a target that has drawn its ire.
##Bullet
 • If the drake’s breath weapon doesn’t recharge at the start of its turn, it will use its movement to descend, use its Crushing Stomp to grapple a target, and lash out with its tail.
##Bullet
 • The drake will use its Wing Attack to take to the air, its tail to attack the grappled target, and then drop that target when it perceives that such a fall would take the target out of the fight.
##Bullet
 • If the drake can use no other action, it will attempt its Arcane Nullification against any harmful magical effect.

##Heading 2
TACTICS

##Body text
The clockwork drake is in many ways a variant of a dragon fight. It has high mobility, dangerous area of effect capabilities, and relies on its flight to get into the air and move around. The clockwork drake is an enemy of moderate intelligence and will generally attack creatures based on their perceived or demonstrated threat to it if it doesn’t have an objective target.

##Body text
Clockwork drakes favor open areas and will generally avoid a fight in enclosed spaces without room to fly around unless forced to fight in such conditions by their objective or purpose.

##Heading 2
CONSIDERATIONS

##Body text
A clockwork drake will pose a very large kill risk to players when deployed in such a fashion. The party’s main goal will be to kill it as fast as possible; otherwise, they will likely succumb to its brutal skill set. Don’t try to keep it alive longer than its shelf life, or it will likely succeed in defeating the players.

##Body text
To increase the drake’s effectiveness, target ranged characters with its smash, grab, and drop combo. Not only will this eliminate the greatest threats, but the targets will also be most likely to fail the save and least able to operate effectively in the clockwork drake’s grasp.

##Heading 2
DEPLOYMENT

##Body text
A clockwork drake can serve as a solo encounter—providing a dangerous, high-stakes fight—but it will wither under heavy, direct fire. It can benefit from some supporting, lower-damage threats to absorb some incoming damage and distract its foes, but it’s extremely deadly when paired with other high-damage combatants. These drakes are best paired with a wizard or golemsmith that can give the fight some dynamic elements.

TRAITS

##Body text
Adamantine Weapons. The drake's weapon attacks are adamantine.

##Body text
Crushing Descent. If the drake flies at least 20 feet downward and then hits a target with a Crushing Stomp attack, the target takes an extra 6 (1d12) bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and grappled by the drake (escape DC 17). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and the drake can't use the same claw on another target.

##Body text
Immutable Form. The drake is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

##Body text
Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the drake fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

##Body text
Lightning Powered. If the drake takes at least 10 lightning damage from any source, it regains 1 spent legendary action.

##Heading 2
BLOODIED

##Body text
Overcharged. If the drake is bloodied (reduced to less than half of its hit points), it starts to crackle with arcs of lightning. Its Flaming Tar Breath automatically recharges, and any creature that hits it with a melee attack before the start of its next turn (including the attack that bloodied it, if applicable) takes 6 (1d12) lightning damage.

##Heading 2
ACTIONS

##Body text
Multiattack. The drake makes two attacks: one with its bladed tail and one with its crushing stomp.

##Body text
Bladed Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) slashing damage.

##Body text
Crushing Stomp. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller target. Hit: 13 (1d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

##Body text
Arcane Nullification. The drake ends one spell effect within 30 feet of it. If the spell is of 6th level or higher, the drake must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 + the level of the spell) to end it.

##Body text
Flaming Tar Breath (Recharge 5–6). The drake unleashes a blast of flaming tar in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 45 (13d6) fire damage and becomes covered in a thick layer of flaming tar. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t covered in tar. While a creature is covered in tar, its speed is halved and it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can spend an action clearing the flaming tar from itself or another creature within 5 feet of it.

##Heading 2
REACTIONS

##Body text
Windy Flapping. The drake adds 5 to its AC against one ranged weapon attack that would hit it. To do so, the dragon must see the attacker and be flying.

##Heading 2
LEGENDARY ACTIONS

##Body text
The drake can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The drake regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

##Body text
Arc. All creatures within 60 feet of the drake take 2 (1d4) lightning damage. Once the drake uses Arc, it can’t use it again until the start of its next turn.

##Body text
Tail Attack. The drake makes a bladed tail attack.

##Body text
Wind Up. The drakeconserves energy to unleash in a burst. It gains 10 temporary hit points, and it can take the Dash action as a bonus action on its next turn.

Few know the origin or purpose of these engines of destruction, only the path of carnage left behind whenever one is unearthed from its ancient resting place. Were these forged as terrifying siege weapons, or are they some form of guardian bereft of purpose and understanding? Whatever their origin, these constructs now serve as a potent warning for anyone who would dare delve too deeply into ancient, ruined history. The journey of many an adventuring group has ended when they unearth one of these ancient destroyers.

##Heading 2
DEPLOYMENT

##Body text
These destroyers most often serve as a dangerous solo encounter, found deep in an ancient ruin best left undisturbed—though perhaps an adventuring group encounters one previously unearthed mid-rampage.

##Body text
They are best fit as a potent campaign foe for a Tier 2 group as they approach 10th level, or as a dangerous obstacle for a group in early Tier 3.

##Body text
They can also serve as a potent lieutenant (or pet) of a higher-level villain in Tier 4, though their damage and disruption mean they will generally remain too potent to be a minion-level threat.

##Heading 2
ANCIENT AND DECAYING

##Body text
These constructs are terrible engines of destruction but are remnants of another era that are barely intact. They are unstable and prone to explosions and devastating ends, wreaking one last burst of carnage on their way out.

##Heading 2
SIMPLE SCRIPT

##Body text
Here’s a simple script that you can follow to get an effective use from an unearthed destroyer.

##Bullet
 • Use Gravity Surge to increase gravity.
##Bullet
 • Move toward the closest target.
##Bullet
 • Cast lightning bolt if it can hit multiple targets or electrocute if it can’t.
##Bullet
 • Bite a target, if possible.
##Bullet
 • Use tail attacks to batter targets in range or cast crackle if no targets are in range. Use lightning charged if no good targets are available.
##Bullet
 • Use Gravity Surge to lower gravity. Cycle raising and lowering gravity, unless there is a flying target, in which case increase the gravity to ground it. The destroyer does not like flying creatures.
##Bullet
 • Only use Annihilation Blast if the destroyer is trapped by magic or its target is defended by magic that would otherwise impede chomping it.
##Bullet
 • Repeat steps.

##Body text
The destroyer is not stupid, but it is simple. It destroys, consuming creatures and turning them to ash. It doesn’t fear destruction, and it particularly dislikes things that attempt to control it or impede it.

##Heading 2
CONSIDERATIONS

##Body text
While a relatively straightforward monster, these creatures are significantly more fatal than they might seem at first glance. Allow a PCs to gather some information about them: an Arcana check of DC 10 or higher might tell the players that the power core looks unstable, and a result of 15 or higher might tell them that any creature that is devoured by the destroyer would be turned to ash. At DC 20 the irreversible nature its Meltdown may be revealed.

TRAITS

##Body text
Death Burst. When the destroyer is reduced to 0 hit points, its power containment fails, unleashing massive destructive power. All creatures within 120 of it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This damage is halved for creatures that are more than 60 feet away from the destroyer.

##Body text
Gravity Surge. As a bonus action at the start of its turn, the destroyer can raise or lower gravity. If it raises gravity, all other creatures within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or fall prone. A flying creature that fails this save falls to the ground even if it has the ability to hover or is being held aloft by magic. If the destroyer lowers gravity, all other creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving or float 10 feet upwards (as if by the levitate spell) until the start of the destroyer's next turn.

##Body text
Innate Spellcasting. The destroyer's innate spellcasting ability is Constitution (spell save DC 19). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

##Body text
At will: crackle*, fling*, lightning charged* 
##Body text
3/day each: electrocute*, jumping jolt*, lightning bolt

##Body text
Unstable Trajectories. If the destroyer has used its Gravity Surge since the start of its last turn, all ranged weapon attacks originating more than 30 feet away from the destroyer that pass within 30 feet of the destroyer are made with disadvantage.

##Body text
Weak Point. When a creature within 10 feet of the destroyer makes an attack against it, the creature can target its power core. On a hit, the attack deals an extra 4 (1d8) damage to the destroyer, and the attacker takes 4 (1d8) lightning damage from the backlash.

##Heading 2
BLOODIED

##Body text
Meltdown. When the destroyer becomes bloodied (reduced to less than half of its maximum hit points), it becomes too damaged to contain its massive power core. At the start of each of its turns, it and all creatures within 60 feet of it must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This is a runaway process that can't be stopped once started. The third time this would occur, the destroyer is instead reduced to 0 hit points, triggering its Death Burst.

##Heading 2
ACTIONS

##Body text
Multiattack. The destroyer makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite, and it can cast a spell in place of either attack.

##Body text
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (3d12 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the destroyer can't bite another target.

##Body text
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage. It can't target a creature grappled by its bite with this attack.

##Body text
Annihilation Blast. The destroyer unleashes a blast of power in a 30-feet cone. Any spell of 7th level or lower in the area ends, and each creature in the area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Structures automatically take maximum damage from this effect.

##Body text
Swallow. The destroyer makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the destroyer, and it takes 22 (5d8) lightning damage at the start of each of the destroyer's turns. If this damage kills the target, it is reduced to fine ash.

##Body text
If the destroyer takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the destroyer must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the destroyer. If the destroyer dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.

##Heading 2
LEGENDARY ACTIONS

##Body text
The destroyer can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The destroyer regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

##Body text
Lightning Power. The destroyer casts one of its at will spells.

##Body text
Move. The destroyer moves up to half its speed.

##Body text
Tail Attack. The destroyer makes one tail attack.

##Heading 2
SILVER RELICS

##Body text
These monsters are a set of minor foes that are relics of a long-lost time... perhaps simply misplaced by a distant civilization. They are advanced constructs with a relatively basic purpose and abilities, but they are highly effective at those simple roles.

##Heading 2
SILVER STALKER

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Sleek, seek-and-destroy units, silver stalkers are a piece of lost technology that adventurers are more likely to encounter. Single minded and dogmatic with an eternal drive, they have a relatively simple and specialized intelligence that entirely revolves around their purpose. They can be intelligent in their ability to track and navigate, but they will rarely apply advanced reasoning.

##Heading 2
TACTICS

##Body text
In combat, silver stalkers will generally employ their heat ray (if they aren't currently frying a target with it), and then move to attack a target that looks like it will be a threat to them. If they are defending a location, they will focus on the first person to enter; if they are hunting a target, they will lock onto it with unreasonable dedication. If they detect a magical or adamantine weapon, they will frequently target that with their heat ray first, trying to eliminate it as a threat. They never consider self-preservation, unless it helps them accomplish their objective.

##Heading 2
USAGE

##Body text
Stalkers can be deployed in a wide range of circumstances and are often the first hint that there is something strange afoot, as they can range further abroad. Created by mages, advanced societies, or parts of ancient tech, these silver relics are an uncommon foe, but one that poses a significant threat early on, and remain a relevant threat throughout the game as a minion due to their high hit chance and the guaranteed damage of their heat ray. Their excessive Stealth, Survival, and Perception make them a useful tool throughout the game, as they are difficult to evade, even with magic.

##Bullet
 • At levels 1-4, a stalker is a solid solo threat that will pose a difficult and dangerous challenge to a party.
##Bullet
 • At levels 5-10, it is no longer a solo threat, but can be a relevant and dangerous facet of an encounter. It is capable of significant damage but will likely die rapidly and should be deployed in numbers.
##Bullet
 • At levels 11-17+, a stalker's impact is relevant but minor. Due to its heat ray and high hit chance, it will remain a threat that has to be dealt with, even if its damage and hit points render it more of a nuisance than a true threat. Its high Dexterity means it has a better chance of surviving area of effect abilities than many lower-level threats.

##Body text
Small, floating contraptions, an unwary observer might deem these tiny, insect-like things a minor threat, but they can prove to be a vexing foe. Most notable for their excellent perceptive capabilities and ability to highlight targets for their allies, they rarely pose a significant threat by themselves, but a wise adventurer is cautious of these sentries in the presence of harder-hitting foes.

##Body text
Most often deployed as sentinels or force multipliers of more powerful foes, these constructs are capable of limited adaptation in their plans, but are dogmatic in their devotion to a purpose, not generally being truly sentient despite their high capacity for reasoning.

##Heading 2
TACTICS

##Body text
Silver sentries often have a primary directive, and when engaging in violent response will do so as efficiently as possible to execute their directive. They are capable of adaptive planning, but they won’t deviate from their task, even in the face of certain destruction.

##Heading 2
USAGE

##Body text
Silver sentries can be deployed as a threat against a low-level group to guard a location of importance, but they are most often deployed as potent support minions for a higher-level, advanced construct threat.

##Bullet
 • At levels 1–4, these are a minor solo threat. They can pose a small challenge to a party due to their all-around hit statistics (high AC, high attack bonus, and damage resistance), but their inability to do large amounts of damage will generally make them not a deadly threat.
##Bullet
 • At levels 5–17+, they remain a significant minion due to the Targeting Lock ability. They will always be an enemy that players will be encouraged to focus down and eliminate first, and they are a thorn in the side of stealthy operations.

##Heading 2
TACTICS

##Body text
Silver soldiers are most effective at a distance and will attempt to engage from range. Even at close range they will often use their ranged attack, relying on their excessively high attack bonus. They can determine the AC of creatures and will use this knowledge to pick their targets efficiently.

##Heading 2
USAGE

##Body text
With a high damage output, they make excellent ranged threats at higher levels, or can be a challenge to overcome in specialized situations where they have cover and positioning.

##Bullet
 • At levels 1–4, silver soldiers are exceedingly dangerous. Their damage is very high, and they have few weaknesses to exploit.
##Bullet
 • At levels 5–10, they are a significant, high-damage threat. They serve as artillery that need to be dealt with but will be somewhat fragile as a solo encounter.
##Bullet
 • At levels 11+, they still make excellent artillery threats that must be respected. Their long range and high attack bonus mean they will remain a significant threat.

LURKING MAW

##Body text
A lurking maw is no natural creature, having slithered out of twisted realms of nightmare beyond the veil of mortal comprehension. They do not need to eat to survive and can live indefinitely lurking in darkness, but possess great hunger, devouring all they encounter.

##Body text
They despise light and life and will seek to destroy either that enters the darkness of their lair. They cannot be drawn out into sunlight or from their lair by almost any means.

##Heading 2
DEPLOYMENT

##Body text
A lurking maw makes a great solo boss encounter for the bottom of a dungeon or forbidden area. It can be an eldritch evil to guard what the heroes must retrieve, the ancient scar of some ill-advised magic or portal, or the lurking nightmare of a forgotten lab or wizard's abode.

##Body text
It can serve as the capstone for a 5th-level party as a known factor they will have to confront, or as a nasty surprise for a higher-level party, becoming a lesser threat beyond 11th level.

##Heading 2
TACTICS

##Body text
There are two important factors when combating a lurking maw: light and mobility. Parties without a way to keep the battlefield illuminated will find themselves in great danger, as even darkvision begins to fail with the multiple instances of magical darkness the lurking maw can produce.

##Body text
The second factor is trying to avoid a creature being consumed, leaving no room for picking them back up. The lurking maw is most deadly when emphasizing these hurdles-by targeting light sources and devouring those that try to make light in its presence, particularly loathsome sources of sunlight.

##Heading 2
SIMPLE SCRIPT

##Body text
Here's a simple script to get the most from a lurking maw. You can use this as a guide when running one:

##Bullet
 • The lurking maw will attempt to ambush an unaware party, though it is unlikely to succeed against a cautious party.
##Bullet
 • It will open with Expunge Light, removing the brightest light source it can or a light source that will plunge the most of its targets into darkness.
##Bullet
 • With many targets available, it will attempt to grapple three of them: one in each tentacle, and one in its maw.
##Bullet
 • Note that while each tentacle can only grapple one target, the lurking maw can still attack a single creature that is isolated against it with multiple tentacles or its bite.
##Bullet
 • As a lair action, it will use Inky Pool to create darkness if there isn't already suitable darkness, or it will use Grasping Darkness to spawn a new maw tendril if suitable darkness is already present.
##Bullet
 • It will use its legendary action as soon as possible to use Mind Terrors, targeting any creature it doesn't have grappled first in priority.
##Bullet
 • While it is waiting for that to recharge, it will use Crush if any target is grappled, or Tentacle Attack if it has no target grappled.

##Heading 2
CONSIDERATIONS

##Body text
The first time a party encounters a lurking maw, be generous with the hints they are going to need. A party with weak light sources will very likely meet their end if they are unprepared, and the lurking maw can even punch above its weight class. Conversely, it lacks durability when heavily exposed to light, losing many of its features and defensive layers.

TRAITS

##Body text
Consuming Hunger. If a creature swallowed by the lurking maw dies, the lurking maw is psionically nourished, regaining 13 (2d12) hit points and either one legendary resistance or one legendary action (its choice).

##Body text
Expunge Light. At the start of its turn, the lurking maw can extinguish one light source within 120 feet of it (no action required). A lightgenerating spell cast with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher can’t be extinguished in this way.

##Body text
Legendary Resistance (2/Day). If the lurking maw fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

##Body text
Lurk. While in darkness, the lurking maw can take the Hide action as a bonus action to hide one of its tentacles.

##Body text
Radiant Weakness. Whenever the lurking maw takes fire or radiant damage, or any damage while it’s in direct sunlight, it takes an extra 3 (1d6) damage of that type.

##Heading 2
BLOODIED

##Body text
Hungering Abyss. The lurking maw’s wounds bleed an inky black, magical smoke that boils up into a haze of magical darkness when it is bloodied (reduced to less than half its maximum hit points), filling the area within a 60-foot radius of it. This haze lasts for 2 (1d4) rounds. This magical darkness is treated as a magical effect created by a 4thlevel spell slot. It also immediately gains 1 additional legendary action. It doesn’t regain this additional legendary action at the start of its turn.

##Heading 2
ACTIONS

##Body text
Multiattack. The lurking maw makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its tentacles.

##Body text
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. A creature grappled in this way takes 7 (3d4) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. If a creature the lurking maw is grappling in this way has 0 hit points at the start of the lurking maw’s turn, that creature is swallowed (no action required), and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the lurking maw, and it takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of the lurking maw’s turns.

##Body text
If the lurking maw takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the lurking maw must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the lurking maw. If the lurking maw dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone. Such a creature can also escape by being cut out of the corpse by a creature dealing 10 slashing damage to it.

##Body text
Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The lurking maw has four tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

##Heading 2
LEGENDARY ACTIONS

##Body text
The lurking maw can take 1 legendary action, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The lurking maw regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

##Body text
Crush. The lurking maw crushes a target it is grappling, dealing 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage to it. If the target is grappled by the lurking maw’s bite, it takes an extra 3 (1d6) piercing damage.

##Body text
Tentacle Attack. The lurking maw makes a single tentacle attack.

##Body text
Mind Terrors (Recharge 5–6). Up to five creatures within 60 feet of the lurking maw must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw, with disadvantage if the creature is in darkness. On a failed save, the creature becomes frightened for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is stunned until the end of its next turn.

##Heading 2
LAIR ACTIONS

##Body text
When fighting inside its lair, a lurking maw can invoke the ambient magic and terrain around it to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lurking maw can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects:

##Body text
Grasping Darkness. A new maw tendril appears in a patch of darkness that is a 5-foot cube or larger. It has AC 15, 15 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and uses a single tentacle attack as if it is the lurking maw. Roll initiative for the tendril. It makes one tentacle attack immediately when it appears and again on each of its turns until it is killed, or until its space is fully illuminated by bright light, destroying the tendril.

##Body text
Inky Pool. A 5-foot-radius sphere of magical darkness (as if by the darkness spell) appears at a point of the lurking maw’s choice within 120 feet of it. This magical darkness grows by 5 feet every round on initiative count 20 until it reaches a 20-foot-radius sphere.
### Layout: end frame

##Heading 2
THE UNCAGED

##Body text
The Uncaged can appear anywhere, operating with unknowable purpose. Some claim they are the souls of ancient warriors, caught up in a planar war through spaces of thought and time until they became the warped forms they now possess. Others speculate they are the fault of some wizard, as so many strange horrors are.

##Body text
They are a seemingly inexhaustible force, appearing in groups lead by their enigmatic wardens. Though extremely dangerous foes, the Uncaged can only exist in the presence of their planar portals or the strange lanterns carried by their wardens. They collapse—crumbling to dust as if aging millenia—when deprived of their connection, making some scholars suspect they have become unmoored from time itself.

##Heading 2
DOORS OF THE UNKNOWN

##Body text
The Uncaged come through mysterious portals, pouring out when they open. Due to their vital connection to these portals, the Uncaged can only travel 1 mile from their portal, and they disappear back through the portal when their work is done. Where these portals go, no one knows. Any attempt to cross such a portal results in the seemingly complete destruction of the object or creature that passes through.

##Heading 2
LANTERNS OF THE WARDENS

##Body text
The exception to this restriction is the wardens, who carry a lantern-like object that projects the same power. An Uncaged can exist as long as it remains within 300 feet of the lantern. If a warden is slain, its lantern is destroyed. Any living creatures within 30 feet of a warden’s lantern find it quickly drains away their life force (as per the warden’s stat block).

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

##Heading 2
PURPOSE AND USE

##Body text
The Uncaged make a set piece encounter that can be freely deployed in many odd situations. They are a force of collectors, enforcers, and investigators of fundamentally unknowable purpose, that can show up to interfere whenever things that manipulate plans, time, or other powerful magics are involved... sometimes connected in ways only they can understand.

##Body text
They rarely speak and never negotiate. They show no hesitation in inflicting terrible casualties to achieve their goals, and they do not fear death or pain. They usually come and go quickly, but sometimes set up longer-term residence within the small sanctuaries of their lanterns.

##Heading 2
TACTICS

##Body text
The Uncaged provide an encounter that largely builds itself. The warden serves as the leader and support of a group of basic Uncaged soldiers, adding and mixing in winged Uncaged as needed. As they are dependent on their wardens, the other Uncaged will work to defend them. These soldiers are simple combatants, but highly effective and deadly. The warden provides the more complicated mechanics of the fight, and it will avoid a direct confrontation, if possible.

True Nature

##Body text
The original nature of the Uncaged are wardens of a planar prison that was destroyed and pulled into a realm of negative energy and madness during the escape of its most dangerous prisoner. They were trapped in their own jail, twisted and warped, bound in eternal duty by their obsession with punishing those responsible. They now scour the planes seeking clues to finally exact their revenge and mete out draconian punishment to whomever they see fit.

##Body text
Innate Spellcasting. The warden’s innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 17). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

##Body text
At will: binding curse*, command, compelled query*, detect thoughts, hold person, inflict wounds, misty step 
##Body text
3/day each: delve mind*, blight, plane shift, psychic drain*, spatial manipulation* 
##Body text
1/day each: banishment, circle of death , fear, hold monster, mind blast*

##Body text
Lantern. The warden’s lantern sheds bright light in a 150-foot radius and dim light for an additional 150 feet, which is visible only to the Uncaged. This light travels through walls and obstacles and can’t be blocked or extinguished. If an Uncaged starts its turn in this light, it gains 4 (1d8) temporary hit points. The warden can see any creature inside the light of its lantern with its truesight.

##Body text
Magic Resistance. The warden has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

##Body text
Unmaking Aura. The unnatural energy of the warden twists the world around it, draining the life from all nearby living creatures. When a living creature starts its turn within 60 feet of the warden, it must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On failed save, it takes 7 (2d6) nectrotic damage.

##Heading 2
ACTIONS

##Body text
Multiattack. The warden uses its Battlefield Presence or Teleport. It then casts a spell.

##Body text
Battlefield Presence. The warden commands an Uncaged to make a single weapon attack. The attack roll is made with advantage.

##Body text
Teleport. The warden magically teleports itself and up to five willing creatures it can see within 60 feet of it, along with any equipment they are wearing or carrying, up to 300 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

##Body text
Uncaged Gate. The warden opens a gate to its unknowable realm. The gate is 10 feet wide and 10 feet tall. Any creature other than an Uncaged that passes through it dies, and can only be resurrected by a wish spell. The gate closes after 1 minute, or when all Uncaged in the area have passed through it.

##Heading 2
ABERRANT ABSTRACTION

##Body text
Few know the true appearance of an aberrant abstraction as their very existence is antithetical to reality and the sane minds that inhabit it. To most, they appear as flashing, flickering, shadowy things of writhing and ever-changing features—the most often reported of which include tentacles, eyes, and mouths. Their appearance seems to be an illusory construct of mortal minds trying to cope with the intersection of reality and abstract unreality, and piercing that veil with truesight drives most creatures instantly mad.

##Heading 2
TACTICS

##Body text
An aberrant abstraction is most often completely chaotic and unpredictable. It doesn’t care about “winning” in a classical sense, and doesn’t comprehend losing. It merely acts in a way that will inflict disorder and chaos, usually entirely randomly.

##Body text
It will ignore other aberrations, but otherwise treats all creatures with equal hostility, unless it is under some sort of psionic compulsion. The true nature of these monsters is incomprehensible, and they can more accurately be considered environmental obstacles than creatures.

##Heading 2
USAGE

##Body text
Aberrant abstractions can be deployed in almost any circumstance in which you want to highlight the unworldly weirdness of an environment: near a breaking down portal, in a psionic scar ripped across the land, or in an ancient temple to an outsider god.

##Body text
They can be added to other encounters with aberrations at higher levels as nuisances that disrupt and wear down players. They also can be used as a solo encounter against low-level parties, or as agents of chaos in fights against other nonaberrations to add an element of randomness and disorder to the fight.

##Bullet
 • At levels 1–4, aberrant aberrations would be a deadly and difficult encounter.
##Bullet
 • At levels 5–10, they are a unique threat, though not a challenging solo encounter, and can play a significant role in encounter design.
##Bullet
 • At levels 11–16, these aberrations remain impactful and provide complexity as minor threats in an encounter.
##Bullet
 • At level 17+, they pose a small, unique challenge and annoyance as minor minions to aberration threats.

##Bullet
 • NPC: Aberrant Abstraction

##Heading 2
ADAPTIVE SLIME

##Body text
A particularly vexing foe, aberrant abstractions are strange slime creatures—likely artificial in nature—that are capable of psionically adapting to not only better suit their environment, but to completely mimic the actions and abilities of those around them. They generally take on the form of other creatures they see, leaving their true form something of a mystery, though they always retain the same slate grey color and have a somewhat melted appearence.

##Heading 2
TACTICS

##Body text
You have several options for the intelligence of these creatures: you can play them as truly cunning, selecting the most devastating ability to copy; you can play them in the middle of just copying whatever did the most damage to them recently (if it did more damage than their Shred Reality would do); or you can play them lacking intelligence, randomly rolling for what they mimic.

##Heading 2
USAGE

##Body text
It is often best that the first time a group of players encounters these it is as a solo set piece. While it will not be an exceedingly difficult encounter in that environment for an appropriately leveled party, it will likely be memorable and they will be forewarned of its abilties if they encounter it in a more difficult, mixed encounter later, upping the tactical nature of that encounter.

##Bullet
 • At levels 1–4, aberrant abstractions are a challenging but not insurmountable threat.
##Bullet
 • At levels 5–10, they remain a challenging encounter, even as a solo threat. While they are unlikely to be deadly, their ability to mimic others can provide something of a scaling threat, particularly in an early encounter. They can be quite deadly at these levels as part of a group encounter.
##Bullet
 • At levels 11–16, they can be a dangerous threat as part of a group due to the difficulty of killing them and their mimic abilities. They should still be considered a significant threat as part of an encounter design at these levels.
##Bullet
 • At level 17+, aberrant abstractions will remain an unusual, dangerous, minion-level threat that will require strategic handling, but they will only provide a challenge when paired with more dangerous enemies.

##Heading 2
RAMPAGING IMPRINT

##Body text
Rampaging imprints are spawned into existence when a powerful psion starts to lose control of its abilities. They are particularly easily created should a psion find themselves in the Astral Plane. It is said that when a particularly powerful psion dies, sometimes hundreds of these undead can be spawned and flung out across the multiverse as the powers explode out of control in the psion’s dying moments.

##Body text
Appearing as a vaguely person-shaped distortion of swirling, purple energy, they are beings of manifested rage, rampaging eternally until destroyed.

##Heading 2
TACTICS

##Body text
A rampaging imprint is most often devoid of tactics, and will attack whatever it sees. When multiple targets are presented, it will most often attack randomly or whatever attacked it last. Some retain a vestige of purpose or intent that will drive them to attack a specific thing.

##Heading 2
USAGE

##Body text
Rampaging imprints can appear anywhere, cast out into the world through psionic events and echoes. However, they rarely coexist with living creatures as they tend to attack things on sight and thus are best off deployed in isolated or otherwise undisturbed areas.

##Body text
If deployed as part of a bigger encounter, they can often serve as summons or minions to similar creatures that direct their otherwise directionless rage through psionic power.

##Bullet
 • At levels 1–4, rampaging imprints pose a moderate threat.
##Bullet
 • At levels 5–10, they are a minor nuisance that can pose a threat to low-Strength creatures, knocking the player characters down to give bigger threats advantage.
##Bullet
 • At level 11+, they are unlikely to be a notable threat.

MIND LURKER

##Body text
An eldritch foe that shows a surprising mimicry of true thought, these twisted lurkers seem to be capable of some degree of patience and planning. They slowly infiltrate the mind of their vicitims and twist them to madness, sewing chaos while lurking in the darkness. If any have learned their name and retained their sanity, records do not indicate.

##Heading 2
USAGE

##Body text
These make excellent solo threats at low levels, usually tied to a plot point or quest. Beyond that, they serve as mind-meddling minions.

MADNESS REGURGITATOR

##Body text
Called “Sargurkthul” by ancient texts, madness regurgitators are a pure example of the twisted imitation of life spouted out by the intersection where the very idea of life is a mockery. These creatures devour (and violently regurgitate) the emotions and psionic energy of living creatures. They can be kept by other aberrations as something akin to horrifying pets.

##Heading 2
USAGE

##Body text
These can serve as an artillery unit for any aberration fight that needs more damage and debuffing. They are not particularly dangerous as a solo threat.

NIGHTMARE STALKER

##Body text
Also known as “Urktathlin” by the rare scholar that has studied beings of the beyond and not gone immediately mad, these creatures seem drawn to those descending into madness, stalking and devouring as their mind deteriorates, savoring that tenuous last grasp of sanity slipping away beneath their fangs.

##Heading 2
USAGE

These are a low-level solo threat that can become an excellent pack minion at higher levels.

FEAR EATER

##Body text
Fear eaters look ponderous and slow, but they can burst into horrifying, lopsided bursts of momentum, bringing all the terror of a jumping spider as they close distance far too quickly for comfort. They possess potent psionic abilities that often reduce their targets to shattered husks before feasting on their flesh. These aberrations are said to gather where the concentrated fear of mortals pools, devouring them and savoring fear and flesh alike.

Introduction

##Heading 2
CRAFTING

##Body text
Crafting has long been a major focus of the game, and something countless players have sought to engage with since the early days; after all, what adventurer wouldn’t want to be better outfitted, better equipped and more prepared... and what adventurer wouldn’t want the chance to put their personal mark on their gear?

##Body text
The core principle of this crafting system is simplicity and specificity. Everything works with simple, easy to follow rules, but has enough depth to lift the burden from a GM having to fill in every blank by giving specific details for everything. While a GM is always the arbiter of what exists and if a crafting recipe works, by and large this system can be run with as much or as little input as a GM wants to add. It’s a complete package that provides all the necessarily details for your players to get started—and plenty of tables and guides for GMs as well.

##Heading 2
WHY DO YOU NEED CRAFTING?

##Body text
Some people may wonder: why do you need a crafting system? Isn’t that what loot is for? The truth is, in some games, that’s true. Not every adventurer is going to want to pursue crafting. But with a crafting system, not only can you craft what you need without finding it in a dragon hoard, what you find in that dragon hoard can be so much more.

##Body text
In a game with a robust crafting system, there is no junk, there are just more opportunities and fresh possibilities. A +1 shortsword that no one can use could be the valuable basis of a new spear. Gems, gold, relics, and recyclables... all valid entry points for the crafter’s creativity.

##Body text
Adventurers are inherently innovative folks on a quest for creative solutions to difficult problems. Crafting gives them that toolbox.

##Body text
So... why do you need crafting? You don’t. But you should probably want it.

##Heading 2
WHO CAN CRAFT?

##Body text
Anyone! Who can succeed in making something useful? Perhaps a bit of a different story. Crafting is not inherently tied to class, though in some cases some classes may give benefits to it (like Inventor); crafting may come from your background in the form of a tool proficiency, or it may be something you learn during your adventures following the old adage of necessity being the mother of invention.

##Body text
Crafting is mostly about the time, effort, knowledge and materials. As such, most of crafting is knowing the recipe and having the time and materials needed... but a skilled craftsman works quicker and is more successful, and in this business practice makes perfect, so there are various progression modifiers that apply. Your GM can determine if your background would merit starting your adventure with any, otherwise guidelines for how to gain them are included.

##Heading 2
WHAT CAN I CRAFT?

##Body text
Anything! But this guide is made by a mere mortal, and is thus limited in scope. This guide will provide the principles of crafting for many fields—from alchemy to engineering to woodworking.

##Body text
The basis of how crafting works is similar between each field, but the recipes, material, and most important results will be radically different... After all, a healing potion, a catapult, and a magic sword are all things you can craft, but the process for each varies quite a bit.

##Body text
The goal of this document is to teach you how to get started, and provide the basics that will get you a long way into your adventure, but not make a complete codex of everything that could potentially be crafted. When you hit something doesn’t appear in this document, just reference the closest items and make a bit of a leap to what extra steps might be needed to realize your vision into your game world!

##Heading 2
A PLAYER-DRIVEN SYSTEM

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
One of the fundamental goals and inspirations of the crafting system is to make it a player-driven system.

##Body text
It is a system where the player can say “I would like to harvest the monster for ingredients” and “I would like to forage as we go through the forest looking for alchemy reagents” and ultimately “I would like to make a healing potion” and all those rules can be exposed to the player allowing them to directly browse and consider what they want to make, as well as how to make it.

##Body text
The GM still adjudicates many instances of them, but the ideal is to have a system in which the GM does not have to handcraft every instance of gathering materials and crafting.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Working With Your GM

##Body text
While the system is meant to enable player-driven choice, always remember to work with your GM. Check in with them when selecting an item you would like to make and confirm that item exists in their world, and any assumptions hold true.

##Body text
Some GMs may rule that some items have higher rarity or are simply not available at their default assigned rarity. A common example of this may be something like Winged Boots, which are only rated as Uncommon, but some GMs may feel they are a better fit for rare and adjust their difficulty accordingly.
### Layout: end frame

##Heading 2
HOOKING YOUR PLAYERS IN

##Body text
On the other hand, if the GM wants to get the players into it, there are some tools they can use. By far the most effective tool is to give the players reagents as part of loot that don’t have an obvious place to sell them. If you give players 2 curative reagents, they are going to start looking into how they can use those, as they’d much rather have a healing potion.

##Body text
If you want to go one further though, if you give them 5 curative reagents and they realize they will have a remainder of one... then they start looking into “Well, how do we get a 6th!”

##Heading 2
DEPTH AND COMPLEXITY

##Body text
This system has two goals: to be simple and easy to use, and to be deep and extensible. Naturally these are somewhat at odds, and accomplished by having a great deal of optional depth. To produce standard items with standard effects, the process for finding or buying the materials and using them to make what you want to make will be straightforward.

##Body text
How much of the detail you want to engage with as a GM can be easily adjusted by how you hand out reagents. By sticking to the standard ingredients and using their generic names, the materials are no more complicated than handing out gold or other rewards (and can even be fully converted easily to a gold-based system if you want the most simplified version), but if you’d like to have specific ingredient names and exotic ingredients there is information in the appendix you can draw from for that.

##Heading 2
HOW TO CRAFT

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Crafting under this system is very simple. You collect the ingredients for a particular thing you want to make, and use your skills with tools to make it into that item. The crafting time of this system is very compressed compared to the systems you might find in the base options because this system is not intended to use downtime to gate crafting.

##Body text
Rather, this is built to work with an adventuring lifestyle. You might need a little time here and there, but it will be measured in hours rather than days and weeks. Consequently, the gates to crafted items are instead the materials and skill required rather than time and gold, though you can certainly use gold to buy those materials in some cases.

##Body text
Following there is a quick summary, as well as more indepth break down of crafting time and checks, materials and where to find them, and finally the specifics of each branch.
### Layout: end frame

##Body text
Generic Ingredients

##Body text
Above and throughout the document, you will see that ingredients are referred to by generic tags like “common curative reagent” rather than specific natures. For example, you may harvest magical herbs, and find Kingsbane in the forest, a poisonous plant. For the purposes of crafting, this can be recorded simply as a “common poisonous reagent” and used as such in crafting.

##Body text
This greatly simplifies the process of crafting and recording what your supplies are. Narratively speaking, a skilled alchemist can render down the ingredients they want to use in the form they need.

##Body text
Each crafting profession will have some profession-wide materials that are used in their recipes: reagents for alchemy, metals for blacksmithing, etc.

##Body text
Some very rare and legendary items will have specific ingredients; this is for flavor rather than balance, though it is up to your GM.

Introduction

##Heading 2
SUMMARY AND REFERENCES

##Heading 2
QUICK SUMMARY

##Body text
Each step will be outlined in more depth, but the following serves as a summary and reference for the process.

##Bullet
 • Select an Item. Find the item you would like to craft on a crafting table.
##Bullet
 • Check with your GM. They will confirm if that item exists and has the default rarity in their game. This system is a tool, it does not supersede worldbuilding.
##Bullet
 • Gather the materials. Materials can be looted from humanoids, harvested from more exotic creature types, purchased at stores, or gathered from the wilderness. The specifics of any material and where it can be found is covered in the materials section.
##Bullet
 • Begin crafting! You can find the related tool and ability score on the table below. Use the related tool and skill to determine your crafting modifier using the following formula:

##Body text
Crafting Modifier = your Related Tool proficiency bonus + your Related Ability Score modifier.

##Bullet
 • You can make progress in 2 hour increments. For each 2 hours spent, make a crafting roll using the formula above and compare the result to the DC listed for the item
##Bullet
 • On failure, no progress is made. If you fail three times in a row, the crafting fails and all materials are lost.
##Bullet
 • On success, 2 hours of progress is made, and you can mark your progress put it aside or continue to craft.
##Bullet
 • Once your completed progress on an item is equal to the crafting time listed, the item is complete.
##Bullet
 • You’re done! Enjoy your shiny new item!

##Body text
Special Reminders:

##Bullet
 • You can “take 10” on a crafting recipe by doubling the crafting time.
##Bullet
 • The final say on any item is up to your GM. If they disagree with the written recipe, they are correct!
##Bullet
 • Don’t be afraid to ask where you can find materials—the GM wants you to engage with the world and find things!
##Bullet
 • A crafting roll is a special kind of check. You can’t apply boosts other than expertise to your crafting check. In general, the only way other than expertise to boost a crafting roll is to get help from another skilled crafted for the entire duration of the craft. Remember you can use the take 10 option to get slower more certain success, and if a craft has a higher DC than you can achieve using that method, it likely should involve some degree of difficulty and risk.

REFERENCE PRICES

##Body text
The prices of this system reference the default prices presented for magic items in 5e, as follows. You don’t need to use these prices if you use an alternate economy, but the prices presented are default for ease of use and conversion.

##Heading 2
DEFAULT PRICING

##Heading 2
##Body text

##Body text
Legendary	25,000+ gp	50,000+ gp

##Body text
Converting Prices

##Body text
There are alternative pricing models presented in the appendix. If you use a simple conversion, such as 1/10th pricing using some sort of silver-based pricing, you can simply divide based on that. If you have a more complicated pricing version, my recommendation is to pick a few core items and use them as a point of reference for a conversion formula (I’d recommend healing potions, +1/+2/+3 weapons, and plate armor).

##Heading 2
VALUABLE ITEMS

##Body text
In some cases, you may want to make something that is more valuable. While selling more valuable gear may be quite difficult, as is often said, magic has expensive tastes. Many magic items that an Enchanter might want require items of a certain value.

##Body text
Here’s some examples of specific modifiers you can add to increase the value of an item:

##Heading 2
##Body text
Modifier	Material	Difficulty	Value Added
##Body text
Bejeweled	Gemstones	+1 per gem	Value of Gem
##Body text
Gilded	10 gold scraps	+2	+20

##Body text
Additionally, you can generally increase the value of an item simply by making it more ornate and exercising greater craftsmanship. You can, when you start crafting an item, raise the DC and/or crafting time of that item artificially. When you do so, that items value is recalculated using the Labor Cost Table in Appendix A.

##Body text
Here is a list of example break points of more expensive mundane items using different variations of material cost, DC, and number of checks. These are all simply the iterations of the formula presented in Appendix A.

##Heading 2

##Body text
Example

##Body text
To walk through these prices:

##Bullet
 • A simple item listed here has 1 sp of materials, and takes 1 check with a DC of 8. That is a labor cost of 1 sp, 1 sp of materials, and consequently, the item has a value of 2 sp.
##Bullet
 • A fancy item here has 100 gp of materials, but also takes 8 checks at a DC of 15! That is a labor cost of 144 gp and a small risk multiplier (the chance you lose your materials) resulting in a value of 250 gp.
##Bullet
 • The presented masterwork item has very little material cost with only 1 gp, but is extremely hard to make with 5 checks with a DC of 20, resulting in a massive labor cost of 995 gp, and a final value of 1,000 gp.

##Body text
So, for example, if you needed a longsword that was worth 1,000 gp, you have a few options:

##Bullet
 • You can add a gem worth 985 gp to the materials when crafting it, resulting in 15 gp + 985 gp.
##Bullet
 • You could raise the checks to 5 and the DC to 20.
##Bullet
 • You could spend 250 gp of materials, raise the DC to 19, and spend 6 checks making it resulting a sword worth 1,103 gp.
##Bullet
 • These cases are largely something you only need to consider when making items for enchanting, and it’s all quite a bit simpler than it might seem, as it’s just expressions of the formula presented in Appendix A.

##Heading 2
MAKING YOUR OWN ITEMS

##Body text
This system is designed to be extensible. While it contains many things, it does not (and cannot!) contain all the things. You can find the rules for building new items in Appendix A: Creating New Items.

##Heading 2
ITEM KEY

##Body text
At some points on the tables that follow you will see some notification such as B . This represents an item that is not core to 5e and has been added by the creator of this Supplement (standing for Bakku).

##Body text
Introduction

##Heading 2
CRAFTING TIME

##Body text
All items have a crafting time measured in hours. Crafting is completed in 2-hour chunks. Some branches of crafting must make all their checks consecutively (like Alchemy) while some do not (like Blacksmithing or Enchanting). A crafting roll is made every 2 hours of work on an item.

##Body text
On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost, and no progress has been made during the 2 hours.

##Body text
If you fail three times in a row, the crafting is a failure, and all materials are lost.

##Heading 2
CRAFTING DURING A REST

##Body text
During a long rest, you can make up to 2 hours of progress during a crafting project if you do nothing else during the long rest besides craft and sleep. During this time, you have disadvantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks and a −5 to all Passive Perception checks as you are focused on your craft.

##Body text
You can make 2 hours of progress on any crafting project by taking this camp action. For most projects, this progress can be banked completing the project 2 hours at a time. For some types of crafting, like alchemy, you can’t make incremental progress, but you can continue for 2 additional hours of crafting before or after a long rest in which you took the camp action “craft” to get 4 hours (for example).

##Body text
Camp Actions

##Body text
A recommended system is the Camp Actions which can be found here and provide more formalized rules for how to make use of your time during a long rest.

##Heading 2
CRAFTING ROLLS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Each profession lists the related ability modifier and tool used to calculate your crafting roll modifier. In many cases, attempting to craft without the applicable tool is impossible. Your GM may allow improvised tools, and in that case the check is made with disadvantage.

##Body text
Beyond the tool, most branches of crafting require a heat source, and some require more infastructure. These are generally approached logically and are at the discretion of the GM. For an adventurer looking for more portable workshop tools, investigate the Crafting Magic Spells and Crafting Utility Magic Items sections; these offer additional avenues for increased portability.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

##Heading 2
TAKING 10

##Body text
When you craft something, double the crafting period (from 2 hours to 4 hours per check) to “take a 10” on the crafting roll, meaning that your crafting checks are 10 + your related ability score + your related tool proficiency bonus. This provides a floor level that you can always succeed on if you choose to take your time.

##Body text
If someone with proficiency is aiding you for the entire duration of the crafting, the crafting check doesn’t gain any bonus, but can be completed in the standard 2 hours.
### Layout: end frame

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Here is a list of some of the additional requirements by branch:

##Bullet
 • Blacksmithing can perform minor crafts with a simple heat source but requires a forge and anvil to make new items.
##Bullet
 • Alchemy and Cooking almost always requires a heat source.
##Bullet
 • Tinkering, Jewelcrafting, and Poisoncraft sometimes require a heat source.
##Bullet
 • Enchanting, Scroll Scribing, Woodworking, Wand Whittling, Poisoncraft, Leatherworking, Engineering, Runecarving rarely require anything besides the tools of the profession.

NPC Crafting

##Body text
It should always be assumed that when NPCs are crafting, they take this option, and thus craft more slowly but reliably. The slap-dash speed crafting is largely the domain of the players, though at the GM’s discretion the players may convince an NPC to craft faster assuming the risk of their materials.

##Heading 2
EXPERTISE

##Body text
Features that grant tool expertise (the ability to add twice your proficiency bonus to ability checks made with a tool) are calculated into your crafting roll modifier, but do not add to the calculated DC the effects of that item have.

##Heading 2
BONUSES

##Body text
A crafting roll is a special type of ability check, and you can’t add temporary bonuses to your roll (such as Bardic Inspiration or the spell guidance) as the crafting roll represents the entire time you spend working the item.

##Body text
In general, the intention is that no external bonuses apply, unless they specifically state they do. This would include feats (such as ones that allow you to reroll certain rolls), class features (such as ones that allows you to add dice to certain rolls), etc. A GM can apply these bonuses, but they are not intended to work, and can result in checks becoming too easy.

##Body text
You can gain advantage if another player with proficiency in the related tool helps for the whole crafting time.
### Layout: end frame

##Heading 2
WORKDAYS

##Body text
When a character is spending all day working, they make 8 hours of progress, and cannot exceed 8 hours working on a crafting project during a day. Players will occasionally want to work longer than 8 hours, but this fails to account for the limitations of mortals: player characters still need to eat, sleep, and will eventually lose their focus and ability to work. This is primarily implemented for balance reasons, but also helps model how much productive time a character can spend; they are not just working 8 hours straight and idling for 8 hours, but rather a model of the natural flow of a day, taking breaks, etc.

##Body text
A GM can choose to overrule this and allow extreme crafting days in special circumstances, but in almost all cases working over 8 hours on a crafting project would leave a character with one or more levels of Exhaustion.
### Layout: end frame

##Body text
Materials

##Heading 2
MATERIALS

##Body text
Without materials, there is nothing to craft from. Crafting does not make things from thin air; it makes more useful things from less useful things. Gathering the materials will be the essential first step in any job. Materials are generally found in three ways.

##Heading 2
LOOTING & SALVAGING

##Body text
Nothing is useless when you have a party of crafters. One of the main sources of materials will be the things you find. Nothing is useless when you have an expert craftsman in the party.

##Heading 2
GATHERING & HARVESTING

##Body text
How something is gathered varies depending on the profession; in many cases, it can only be gathered when the opportunity arises. Dragon scales, for example, are a lot easier to gather when there is a dead dragon nearby. Be it harvesting rare herbs, monster parts, or minerals, gathering is an opportunity you won’t want to pass up.

##Heading 2
PURCHASING

##Body text
Rarely will everything you need to craft what you want fall into your hands without the assistance of the oldest and most powerful tool of any craftsman: money. When you don’t have what you need, frequently you can buy it. For some professions, there will be a lot more materials that can be purchased, while others will rely more on the other routes.

##Body text
Selling and Buying Materials

##Body text
In general, the buying price of a material is its listed value, and its selling price is usually half of that to an interested property. Between negotiation, market fluctuation, and GM moods, you may get better or worse prices. Note that many materials are simply junk to a party that does not have a use for them and will only sell to interested parties that can use or resell them. Threatening to burn down a merchant’s shop because they will not offer you the listed price may result in an Intimidation check but does not change market realities and is typically not beneficial to your reputation; most merchants that have the gold to buy and sell expensive materials have dealt with adventurers before and are not easily intimidated.

##Body text
The sources of materials are tied to the pillars of the game. Looting and Harvesting are tied into the combat pillar, Salvaging and Gathering are tied into the exploration pillar, and Purchasing and Rewards are tied into the social pillar. This provides a lot of routes to add these materials to your game based on what works best for your group.

##Heading 2
TYPES OF MATERIALS

##Heading 2
REAGENTS

##Body text
Reagents are a huge range of things; most often they are plants that contain some magical essence, but almost as frequently they are harvested from various magically inclined monsters. The exact source of a reagent usually does not matter beyond defining its type, as the part of the reagent used is the fragment of magic contained within that is distilled out.

##Body text
There are many different ways to make a potion. Consequently, the materials are sorted into categories. These categories include curative, reactive, and poisonous. These each come in the standard material rarities: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary.

##Body text
Reagents can’t be salvaged once they have been combined into another form (such as potions, essences, or ink).

##Body text
Reagants can be assumed to weigh 0.2 pounds each.

##Body text
Interchangeable Reagents

##Body text
All curative, reactive, and poisonous ingredients are interchangeable. This is intentional to drastically simplify the crafting process and tracking thereof. Individual names are included only to deepen the immersion of the finding and buying ingredients, and can be treated as interchangeable by their label if preferred.

##Heading 2
MAGICAL INK

##Body text
While ink has many uses, crafting is mostly concerned with magical ink which has the power to hold the arcane words of scrolls. This is synthesized by alchemists from the magical properties of reagents, as it is concerned with extracting their magical properties, the exact nature of the reagents used do not effect the final ink beyond its potency.

##Body text
Magical ink is not typically found or harvested on its own, though it may be found as loot, and in some instances a GM could rule that some blood collected from a fiend, celestial or dragon could be counted as such. It is generally created from reagents or purchased from alchemists that create it from reagents.

##Body text
Magical ink can’t be salvaged once they have been combined into another form (such as potions, essences, or ink).

##Body text
Magical Ink can be assumed to wight 0.1 pounds each.

##Heading 2
ESSENCES

##Body text
While reagents are substances that contain a glimmer of magical power that can be harnessed through refinement, Essences are more purified forms of magical power. These come in three types: Arcane, Divine and Primal as well as in the five normal rarities (common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary). These essences are the pure stuff of magic that makes things work.

##Body text
You can get these by rendering down magical reagents, salvaging magic items, harvesting them from magical monsters, or through the hard work of spell casters. Or you can find them as loot from people that have already done one of those harder steps. The rules for rendering them down from materials are contained within each branch of crafting, while the rules for creating them yourself are under Enchanting, as it is their domain and skill set needed to do so.

##Body text
While all branches occasionally use essences when extra magical power is needed, they are the primary material of Enchanters, and their pricing can be found in that section.

##Body text
Essences can be found as loot during the courses of your adventures, but can also be harvested (from monsters), salvaged (from magical equipment), synthesized (from reagents), or created from the raw power of a spell caster, though the method is long and arduous.

##Body text
Essences are flexible in their exact nature. There are many paths to each desired outcome, and this flexibility is represented in Essences. While the traditional way to make a belt of hill giant strength may call for a hill giant heart as its essence, an enchanter may substitute a dragon heart as their primal essences to make a belt of dragon strength that just has the same statistical effect.

##Body text
Essences can be assumed to weigh 1 pound each.

SALVAGING ESSENCES

##Body text
You also may be able to salvage magical essence from unwanted or broken magical items, though such a reclamation process can be difficult, and rarely results in more than a fraction of the essence infused into the original item. An item returns one essence equal to its rarity when harvested. The process takes 2 hours to complete, and doesn’t work if the item is currently attuned to any creature. An essence can only be salvaged from permanent magic items; a permanent magic item is one that recharges or doesn’t have a limitation on its charges or uses. A magic item with charges or uses can only be salvaged while it is at full charges or uses. The item becomes nonmagical after the essence is salvaged from it. If it required magic to function or exist, it is destroyed.

##Heading 2
SYNTHESIZING ESSENCES

##Body text
In addition to harvesting essences from magical monsters fully intact, a more approachable and incremental way is to combine several reagents to get an essence. You have to combine three reagents of the same rarity to gain one essence of that rarity. You can combine reagents in the following ways:

##Heading 2
##Body text
Essence	Component Reagents
##Body text
Arcane	1 curative, 1 poisonous, 1 reactive
##Body text
Primal	3 reactive
##Body text
Divine	2 curative, 1 reactive

##Body text
This process takes 4 hours, and requires alchemist’s supplies and a heat source.

##Heading 2
MAKING ESSENCES

##Body text
Another potential source of an Essence is being created by a spellcaster. This process is long and arduous, and typically only suited to downtime. A creature with the spell casting feature can create 1 essence during 1 workweek (5 days, 8 hours a day); this process can’t be completed faster and for the duration they are considered to have spent all of their spell slots.

##Body text
At 1st level or higher can make a common essence in this way, a caster 5th level or higher can make an uncommon essence this way, a caster at 11th level can make a rare essence in this way, and a caster at 17th level or higher can make a very rare essence this way. Legendary essences require special rituals, more casters, and take far longer; they are exceedingly hard to make.

##Body text
The type of essence produced depends on the source of the spell casting levels as per the table below:

Special Cases Explained

##Bullet
 • Sorcerers produce a type based on their subclass; Dragon or Wild makes Primal, Divine Soul makes Divine, and Shadow makes Arcane.
##Bullet
 • Warlocks likewise produce a type based on their subclass; Archfey makes Primal, Celestial makes Divine, and all others make Arcane.
##Bullet
 • Occultist can produce any type, but takes 1.5x as long to produce an Essence in this manner. A GM can rule based on the special circumstances of a character their power source may be different than normal. This can stand in for Shaman, Witch, or Oracle classes if you use those instead of Occultist.
##Bullet
 • Inventor can stand in for any half-arcane caster of a similar theme.

##Body text
A half- or third-caster would generate essences at 1/2 or 1/3 their character level, respectively.

##Heading 2
INGOTS

##Body text
Ingots are chunks of metal that can be used to craft things. They are assumed to be relatively pure and weigh 2 pounds each. The default ingot listed in all the crafting tables is an ingot of Steel. These cost 2 gp per ingot. There are cheaper metals (such as Iron); pure Iron can’t be used to craft weapons and armor, but can be used for other items, resulting in a cheaper item. On the other end of the spectrum, more advanced metals such as Mithral and Adamantine can be used conferring special properties, but being far more difficult to work with and costing more.

##Body text
Ingots can be assumed to weight 2 pounds each.

##Heading 2
SALVAGING INGOTS

##Body text
Metal items can be converted back to ingots quite efficiently, but require a forge to do so. With a forge and 2 hours per item, a metal item can be rendered down into its component ingots. Advanced metals may require special tools to smelt.

##Heading 2
SMELTING ORE

##Body text
Creating ingots from raw ore is largely out of scope for most adventurers, but you can create ingots from raw ore with a suitable facility. For more details see the Components and Materials table under Blacksmithing.

##Heading 2
HIDES & LEATHER

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Hides, scales, and carapaces all tend to be harvested from monsters. Leather is a product of hides that can be processed from what it is harvested from the monster.

##Body text
The GM determines if a monster provides hide, scale, or carapace. Hides do not come in different sizes, rather larger creatures simply provide more hides, and monsters that are not large enough to produce one hide provide only hide scraps.

##Body text
Scales are likewise abstracted: each increment is simply an arbitrary unit of scales that the unit of scales covers. Scales can be much larger or small from different-sized creatures.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Processing Hides

##Body text
The process of turning hide into leather takes quite awhile (as per the crafting table), and is often something adventurers can delegate to NPCs (delivering hides to be processed) or do during downtime. If you would like a more expedited system, there is no balance reason for this, and you can short the leather crafting process to taking 2 hours, it just won’t be exceedingly realistic.
### Layout: end frame

##Body text
Like other crafting branches, there are also named components for more iconic pieces of gear—the stock of a crossbow, for example, or other items. The cost for these items can be found on the common component table, and are generally minor.

##Body text
Lastly, Tinkerers use essences when constructing things that push beyond the mundane principles of plausibility, crafting magical properties into their inventions.

##Heading 2
PARTS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
The term “parts” is used to refer to gears, wires, springs, windy bits, screws, nails, and doodads. Parts can be either found or salvaged or forged from metal scraps (or even straight from ingots by a Blacksmith for those that really want to be industrial about it). The exact nature of each item making up this collection is left abstracted.

##Body text
In addition, metal scraps are collections of salvaged material that generally fall into the category of things “too small to track” which can then be used for the creations of tinkerers. In addition to all of this, occasionally tinkers will use ingots... particularly ones of tin (which is their namesake, after all).

Named Components

##Body text
In almost all cases, named components (such as a “wooden stock” for a crossbow) can be simply abstracted out as a minor cost, but, as always, the level of abstraction is up to the GM.
### Layout: end frame

##Heading 2
SALVAGING PARTS

##Body text
The other main way to acquire parts is to salvage them. What can be salvaged is determined by the GM, but in general common items provide parts, uncommon or expensive items may provide fancy parts, and esoteric parts are found only from esoteric sources at your GM’s discretion. Tools, vehicles, and complex items generally return 1d4 metal scraps and 1d4 parts for a Small or smaller item, 2d6 metal scraps for a Medium-sized item, 3d8 metal scraps for a Large-sized item, and more for larger items, though they may return less of rare types of parts.

##Heading 2
WOOD

##Body text
Commonly available in its lowest quality (firewood), higher quality woods are often found in rather exotic locations. Wooden branches (including wood scraps) are assumed to be of a useful wood that can be worked, while firewood covers everything else, with more useful woods falling into categories such as “quality branches” or rarer options. Wood scraps are assumed to be scraps of common branch quality wood, and consequently can’t be salvaged from firewood. Wooden branches can be assumed to weigh 2 pounds each.

##Heading 2
SALVAGING

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
For the most part, wood can’t be easily salvaged. Wood carving is not necessarily a reversible process, and wood can’t be smelted down.

##Body text
You can render wooden crafted product into wood scraps equal to 4 x the number of branches used to create it.

Quality Branch

##Body text
A quality branch refers to one that can be made into more precious objects, particularly bows. It is nonmagical in nature, but typically yew when dealing with bows, though ash, mulberry, elm, oak, hickory, hazel, and maple can be used under broader definitions.

##Heading 2
HARVESTING & LOOTING

##Body text
Harvesting and looting are two paths to the same place, but generally depend on what kind of foe was vanquished and you are now collecting the “stuff” of. Typically humanoid creatures that carry stuff are candidates for the Individual Treasure tables, while Aberrations, Beasts, Dragons, Monstrosities, and Plants are harvesting candidates.

##Body text
If you don’t normally provide loot equivalent to default treasure tables, you don’t need to start providing loot equivalent to them using these new tables, simple apply these tables as frequently as it makes sense for your game.

##Body text
Remember that you can fully mix and match as it makes sense. You can replace coinage with gems or art pieces, you can replace crafting items that wouldn’t make sense with coinage, gems, or art pieces, etc. The tables are merely a guide and convenience for what sort of range of materials should come from what sort of creature.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

##Heading 2
HARVESTING

REMNANTS

LOOT

##Body text
The Loot tables optionally replace the Individual Treasure for humanoid type creatures. You can use this table in all cases or in some cases.

##Heading 2
HOARDS

##Body text
Rather than replacing the hoard tables, simply use the default hoard table and replace an amount of coins, gems, and art pieces with crafting materials. This ensures that players are still getting the sort of loot they expect, but also fills in new materials into things that would often fill little role beside being converted to coinage at a later date.

Recommendation

##Body text
I would recommend using the table for all humanoid enemies, but using the Equivalent Gold Value for roughly half of enemies to keep gold flowing into the PCs pockets while also providing abundant crafting supplies.
### Layout: end frame

##Heading 2
BASIC HARVESTING

##Body text
Beasts, Dragons, and Monstrosities can be harvested using Wisdom (Survival) for meat and hides. At a GM’s discretion, a Plant type creature can be harvested for food using the same DC and amount, but providing common fresh ingredients instead of meat. Basic Harvesting takes 10 minutes. At your GM’s discretion, it may take longer for larger creatures.

##Heading 2
EXOTIC CREATURE HARVESTING

##Body text
Applicable Targets: Aberration, Constructs, Dragons, Monstrosities, Plants, Some Undead

##Body text
A random roll is performed to judge what can be harvested from the monster. For Dragons and Monstrosities, a Wisdom (Medicine) check is required to harvest the material without destroying it, for Constructs, an Intelligence (Arcana) check is required, and for Plants an Intelligence (Nature) check is required. Exotic Harvesting takes 10 minutes. At your GM’s discretion, it may take longer for larger creatures.

##Body text
If a beast is sufficiently magical, poisonous, or venomous, a GM can opt to use the Dragon & Monstrosity table for exotic harvesting, but this should be rare; even a poisonous beast is usually too mundane for the magical properties of harvested materials, and a beast should always be rolled on the 0–4 CR table regardess of its CR.

##Body text
At a GM’s discretion, some Undead may be harvested as well if there is something that would make sense for them to provide in this manner, in which case they would use an Intelligence (Arcana) check. Undead are less likely to provide anything of use, simply having a rare chance of providing arcane essences, though some would consider the use of these essences evil.

##Body text
Double Harvesting

##Body text
If a monster is applicable for both Basic Harvesting and Exotic Harvesting, you can perform both, but the second check has disadvantage on the roll to successfully gather the materials.

##Heading 2
EXOTIC REMNANTS

##Body text
Applicable Targets: Celestials, Elementals, Fiends, Some Undead

##Body text
Some creatures typically do not leave behind corpses. While these most often disappear without a trace, sometimes they will leave behind a fragment of the magical forces that powered them as a remnant, in the form of a reagent or essence. These are less likely to result in a crafting item, but don’t require any check to gather it successfully. Gathering remnants is simple to do, and requires only 1 minute.

##Body text
Applying Material Tables

##Body text
As a GM, never feel compelled to roll on a table if you feel it makes sense to do something else. The tables provide a baseline, but if you feel that it makes sense of a given monster to leave behind a given material, simply do so, requiring the check that seems most appropriate (using the tables as a guide if you wish).

Gathering

##Heading 2
GATHERING

##Body text
Many of the materials can simply be found growing in the wild, and can be gathered by someone that knows what to look for and spends the time doing just that. When traveling at a slow pace through wilderness for 8 hours or more (i.e. not urban land or farmland), you can make a gathering check, but have disadvantage on the check to harvest anything found.

##Body text
If you dedicate 8 hours to gathering without traveling, you can make two checks (without disadvantage) or find one item other than an essence of your choice that is available within that biome’s table (making the ability check from the corresponding line of the table to harvest it) or 1d12 of any trivial item (making a DC 8 ability check to harvest it).

##Body text
The found items then have to be gathered. You can choose to gather reagents, search for materials, or hunt wild game. Roll a d100 and consult the corresponding table below for the relevant biome to determine what is found.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

##Heading 2
GATHER REAGENTS

##Body text
Reagents are harvested by making a Wisdom check. If you have an Herbalism kit and are proficient with it, you can add your proficiency bonus to the roll.

##Heading 2
SEARCH FOR MATERIALS

##Body text
Materials can be harvested with your choice of a Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom check. If you have proficiency with the Survival skill, you can add your proficiency bonus to the roll.

##Heading 2
HUNT GAME

##Body text
Food can be gathered with your choice of a Dexterity or Wisdom check. If you have proficiency with the Survival akill, you can add your survival modifier to the roll.

Intentionally Slow

##Body text
Gathering is a time gated system. It is not intended to be the primary source of materials. Rather than being balanced against the loot tables, it’s balanced against the down time activities (and consequently not particularly efficient).

Alchemy

##Heading 2
ALCHEMY

##Body text
Alchemy is a crafting art that almost all adventures have some degree of interest in the results of. The source of the ever in demand Potion of Healings, it is a versatile trade that fuels (sometimes quite literally) the adventuring life.

##Body text
It doesn’t take many experiences with the powers of potions for an adventurer to consider if they can get away with simmering a Potion of Healing next to the stew over that night’s cooking fire... of course it’s easier said than done for the result of such things to come away not poisonous.

##Body text
Alchemy tends to be a very quick form of crafting, but with this comes additional risks with most crafts resting on a single roll, and failure resulting in the loss of all materials. Although taking that chance is frequently worth it during a busy adventuring season, consider the “Taking 10” option outlined in the craft introduction when speed is not of the essence.

##Heading 2
RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

##Body text
Alchemy works using alchemist’s supplies. Attempting to craft a potion without these will almost always be made with disadvantage, and proficiency with these allows you to add your proficiency to any alchemy crafting roll.

##Body text
Alchemy uses your choice of your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier.

##Heading 2
QUICK REFERENCE

##Body text
While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to make a potion in its most basic form:

##Bullet
 • Select a potion that you would like to craft from the “Potions Crafting Table”.
##Bullet
 • Acquire the items listed in the materials column for that potion.
##Bullet
 • Use your alchemist’s supplies tool to craft the potion using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the crafting time is 2 hours or less. Alchemy items must be crafted in a single session.
##Bullet
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus with alchemist’s supplies. You can abort the craft after a bad crafting roll if you wish, this counts as a failure.
##Bullet
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the magic item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure and all materials are lost.

##Heading 2
SHELF LIFE & EXPIRED POTIONS

##Body text
A unique attribute to alchemy, potions once crafted have a shelf life of 1 year before coming expired. This shelf life is shortened to 1 month if the potion contains any reactive ingredient.

##Body text
If an expired potion is used or consumed within double its shelf life, roll a d4. On a 1, you become poisoned for 1 minute. On a 2 or 3, the potion will work with reduced effect; its duration will be halved if it had a duration, and damage or healing it dealt will be halved. On a 4, it works as expected.

##Body text
Any potion that is older than twice its shelf life has no effect besides causing the imbiber to become poisoned for 1 minute.

##Heading 2
CRAFTING ROLL

##Body text
Putting that together means that when you want to work on Alchemy, your crafting roll is as follows:

##Body text
Alchemy Modifier = your Alchemist’s Supplies proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice)

##Heading 2
SUCCESS AND FAILURE

##Body text
For Alchemy, after you make the crafting roll and succeed mark your progress on a crafting project. If you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item). Checks for Alchemy must be consecutive, meaning that if you wish to continue after a failed craft, you need to extend your crafting time.

##Body text
Failure means that no progress is made during that time. Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components reserved for that item can only be recovered via salvage. If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged.

##Heading 2
ALCHEMY SAVING THROW

##Body text
Some alchemical creations trigger a saving throw. In instances that they do, the following is the formula for calculating the saving throw. The saving throw is calculated at the time of creation based on the creators attributes and proficiency, and doesn’t change once it is created.

##Body text
Alchemy DC = 8 + your Alchemist’s Supplies proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom Modifier (your choice)

##Body text
Herbalist's Limited Alchemy

##Body text
While herbalism is primarily used for gathering herbs, a creature with proficiency with herbalism kits has a limited proficiency in creating potions in addition to gathering herbs. You can use proficiency with an herbalism kit in place of alchemist’s supplies when creating potions of healing , antidotes, antitoxins, and vials of poison.

##Body text
When crafting in this way, you use an herbalism kit and proficiency with it in place of alchemist’s supplies. This crafting otherwise works the same as using alchemist’s supplies.

##Body text
You can add additional reagent modifiers when crafting in this way.

##Body text
Crafting Walk Through: Alchemy

##Body text
Here’s a quick example of how alchemy will often play out in a game.

##Body text
Caius the Wizard is saved from being eaten by a giant plant monster. He wants to know if his suffering was worth anything, so he asks the GM if there was any loot. There wasn’t. Was there anything to harvest from the monster? Well, that’s always possible. The GM asks for a d100. Caius rolls a 54.

##Body text
It was just a CR 4 monster, so the GM consults the table and asks for a DC 8 Nature Check. Fortunately Caius the Wizard has a +3, so only needs a 5, and rolls an 8. Harvesting successful and now he has 1 common curative reagent.

##Body text
Knowing that he’s going to need some healing potions to survive the next plant monster, he consults the table and realizes that with just 2 more curative reagents and a glass vial he’d have enough materials.

##Body text
Next time they walk through a forest, Caius the Wizard asks the GM if there are any reagents about. Slowing down to a slow pass, he can make a gathering check with disadvantage, and attempts to gather reagents. Rolls the d100, and comes up with a 73. The GM asks for a DC 10 gathering check using herbalism kit, with disadvantage as they were travelling. Caius doesn’t have proficiency, but has +1 wisdom, so needs a 9 or higher. He rolls a 14!

##Body text
The results in 1d4 common curative reagents. He rolls a 2. That’s all the curative reagents he needed! He cleans out the remains of an old healing potion to get a glass vial, and next time they camp, he spends his camp action (2 hours) trying to make a healing potion.

##Body text
He needs to succeed only once, DC 13. Fortunately he has proficiency in alchemist’s supplies, and a +3 Intelligence, meaning his check is at +5. He needs an 8 or higher.

##Body text
...He rolls a 3. This a failure! But all is not lost, he can keep trying until he fails 3 times in a row... but he’s already spent his 2 hours, and alchemy checks must be made consecutively.

##Body text
Not wanting to lose his precious hard won reagents, he stays up late making another check. He rolls a 10! This results in a 15! He’s successfully made a Healing Potion!

##Body text
Unfortunately he’s stayed up too late, but the next morning the party lets him sleep in to avoid the level of exhaustion.

##Body text
Two days later, Vandrin the Cleric, the groups only healer, is on death’s door! A quick swig of the healing potion gets him back on his feet, and the day is won thanks to the hard work of making a potion, and adventurers keep a keen eye out for more of those curative reagents!

DRAUGHT OF DAMNATION

##Body text
Potion, rare

##Body text
This sticky red liquid has a living viscosity to it, churning slowly within the flask. When you drink this potion, you become a fiend (as if by the spell shapechange for 1 hour). The type of fiend you become is determined by your level. The new form is a random fiend with a Challenge Rating equal to your level, up to a maximum of 10. If there are multiple options at that Challenge Rating, roll to determine which option is selected.

##Body text
When the effect ends and you revert to your normal form, you take 1d6 necrotic damage equal to the CR of the fiend who’s form you assumed as the toxins of pure evil attempt to destroy your body before relinquishing control of it. If this damage kills you, your soul is dragged to the realm of the fiends by the malignant will of the fiend.

NAIL BOMB

##Body text
Explosive, uncommon

##Body text
A brutal instrument, this mixes explosive powder and nails to create a devastating fragmentation device. An exceedingly dangerous device. Heavier and more deadly than other explosives, the primary damage comes from the metal shrapnel (nails) flung in all directions. It can be detonated by dealing 1 fire or lightning damage to it. As an action, a packet of this explosive can be accurately thrown 20 feet, but will not detonate on impact (usually). When it detonates, all creatures within 20 feet of the target point must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to the crafter’s Alchemy DC. On failure, they take 8d4 piercing damage, or half as much on a success.

##Body text
You can fuse your explosives. When fused, intentionally dealing fire damage to the explosives (or otherwise lighting the fuse) causes it to detonate on a delay, selected from: short (the end of your turn), medium (the start of your next turn), and long (2 rounds, at the start of your turn).

ALCHEMY MODIFIERS

##Body text
The following are alchemical modifiers that can be applied to a potion. All alchemical modifiers require approval from the GM if the modifier will work with a given potion or creation.

##Heading 2
##Body text
Modifier	Difficulty Modifier	Effect
##Body text
Aerosol	+8	Require two additional reactive reagents of equal rarity to the rarest reagent of the potion. Rather than drinking it, when uncorked or broken (as an action) it effects all creatures in a 5-foot radius as if they’d consumed it.
##Body text
Celestial	+3	Requires a common divine essence. Adds the effect of lesser restoration to the potion.
##Body text
Divine	+6	Requires an rare divine essence. Adds the effect of greater restoration to the potion.
##Body text
Endothermic	+4	Any fire damage the potion does becomes cold damage
##Body text
Expansive	+5	Requires an additional common reactive reagent. Expands the area of effect of any area of effect the potion has by 5 feet.
##Body text
Insidious	+3	The effect of the potions becomes shrouded from magic such as identify. You can make the potion appear as another potion of the same rarity. Another alchemist can identify it by making an Alchemy Check against your Alchemy DC

##Heading 2
ADDITIONAL MATERIALS

##Body text
You can simply load more reagents into any potion, increasing its potency in different ways, though it increases the difficulty. You can make a “custom potion” simply by using these modifiers with no base potion. When you do so, the base DC is 8.

Poisoncraft

##Heading 2
POISONCRAFT

##Body text
A subdomain of alchemy, the profession of poisoncraft is often seen as the “dark side” of Alchemy. While Alchemy often deals in poisonous reagents, typically speaking they aim to tame the poison, channeling it into useful effects. While capable of making crudely poisonous potions, such things are generally considered failures to an alchemist. To a poisoner, they are considered the art itself.

##Body text
Poisoncraft shares Shelf Life and Reagents with Alchemy; for details regarding those, see Alchemy.

##Heading 2
RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

##Body text
Poisoncraft works using a Poisoner’s Kit. Attempting to craft a potion without these will almost always be made with disadvantage, and proficiency with these allows you to add your proficiency to any poisoncraft crafting roll.

##Body text
Poisoncraft uses your choice of your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier, representing your path of knowledge to the art of making deadly things deadlier.

##Heading 2
QUICK REFERENCE

##Body text
While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to make a poison in its most basic form:

##Bullet
 • Select a poison that you would like to craft from the “Poison Crafting Table”.
##Bullet
 • Acquire the items listed in the materials column for that potion.
##Bullet
 • Use your Poisoner’s Kit tool to craft the option using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the crafting time is 2 hours or less. Poisoncraft items must be crafted in a single session.
##Bullet
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus with a Poisoner’s Kit. You can abort the craft after a bad crafting roll if you wish, this counts as a failure.
##Bullet
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the magic item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure and all materials are lost.

##Heading 2
CRAFTING ROLL

##Body text
Putting that together means that when you would like to create poison, your crafting roll is as follows:

##Body text
Poisoncraft Modifier = your Poisoner’s Kit proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice).

##Heading 2
SUCCESS AND FAILURE

##Body text
For Poisoncraft, after you make the crafting roll and succeed, mark your progress on a crafting project. If you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item). Checks for Poisoncraft do not need to be immediately consecutive. Failure means that no progress is made during that time. Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components reserved for that item can only be recovered via salvage.

##Body text
If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged.

##Heading 2
POISONCRAFT SAVING THROW

##Body text
When a poison requires a saving throw, the following is the formula for calculating the saving throw. The saving throw is calculated at the time of creation based on the creators attributes and proficiency, and doesn’t change once it is created.

##Body text
Poison DC = 8 + your Poisoner’s Kit proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom Modifier (your choice).

##Heading 2
POISONS

##Body text
Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures.

##Body text
Poisons come in the following four types.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Contact. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.

##Body text
Ingested. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You might decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Inhaled. These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.

##Body text
Injury. Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage. An injury poison typically lasts 1 minute on a weapon, and lasts for up to 5 hits. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.

##Heading 2
BLACKSMITHING

##Body text
Blacksmithing is a popular professional interest of two sorts of adventurers: those that want to hit things with heavy metal objects, and those that want a heavy metal object between them and the thing hitting them.

##Body text
While often relying on the town blacksmith to do their work for them is a fine option, rolling up your sleeves and doing the work yourself can allow you to express your creativity... and may save you a few coins in the process.

##Body text
Blacksmithing is slow hard work, but has a higher tolerance for failure than most, and is more dependent on knowing your material, as the templates you work from tend to be common across many of them.

##Heading 2
RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

##Body text
Blacksmithing works using blacksmith’s tools. Attempting to craft an item without blacksmith’s tools will often be impossible, though a GM may let you use makeshift tools to make a check with disadvantage. Proficiency in blacksmith’s tools allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any blacksmithing check.

##Body text
While Blacksmiths can benefit from their skills in small ways such as sharpening their weapons and retrofitting their gear on the go, many of their crafting options require a fully equipped Forge; a fully equipped Forge entails forge, anvil, and blacksmith’s tools.

##Heading 2
QUICK REFERENCE

##Body text
While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to make a blacksmith item in its most basic form:

##Bullet
 • Select the item that you would like to craft from any of the Blacksmithing Crafting Tables.
##Bullet
 • Acquire the items listed in the materials column for that item.
##Bullet
 • Use your blacksmith’s tools to craft the option using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column.
##Bullet
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus with blacksmith’s tools.
##Bullet
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the item is complete.
##Bullet
 • On failure, the crafting time is lost, and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure, and all materials are lost.

##Body text
Magical Forges

##Body text
The worlds of the planar multiverse are a fantastical place with many wonders. Sometimes you may find locations that have been constructed in such a way as to leverage powerful primal powers in the forging technique: for example, a forge at the heart of a volcano or atop an ever-frozen glacier, which might imbue items crafted there with special properties.

##Heading 2
CRAFTING ROLL

##Body text
Putting that together means that when you would like to smith an item, your crafting roll is as follows:

##Body text
Blacksmithing Modifier = your Blacksmith’s Tools proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier

##Heading 2
SUCCESS AND FAILURE

##Body text
After you make a crafting roll, if you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item).

##Body text
Checks for Blacksmithing do not need to be immediately consecutive. If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged. Failure means that no progress is made during that time.

##Body text
Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components reserved for that item can only be recovered via salvage.

MAINTENANCE & MODIFICATIONS

##Body text
While the primary purpose of Blacksmithing is to forge armor and weapons from metal, for an adventurer such events are important milestones that generally will not occur every day. The following are some tasks that require proficiency with Blacksmith’s Tools that provide a more day-to-day utility to the proficiency, giving them minor ways to enhance or adapt their gear.

##Body text
These are minor crafts that can be completed in 2 hours (or as one camp action when using the Camp Actions rules) with the expenditure of 5 gp worth of materials. They can be done as part of a long rest but have limitations the normally crafted items do not (such as a maximum stockpile of minor crafts).

##Heading 2
MAINTAIN GEAR

##Body text
One of the perks of having a blacksmith in the field is their ability to keep gear in its best condition, giving you an edge (sometimes literally) in the quality of your gear and weapons. Over the course of 2 hours, a Blacksmith can maintain a number of weapons or sets of armor equal to their proficiency bonus, granting each weapon or armor maintained a special d6 Quality Die.

##Body text
For a weapon, this can be rolled and added to an attack or damage roll, representing a case where the perfect state of the gear turned a miss into a hit or dealt a bit of extra damage. For a set of armor, the die can be rolled when hit by an attack, and the damage taken from that attack can be reduced by that amount.

##Body text
Rolling this die doesn’t require an action, but once rolled it is spent and can’t be regained until the blacksmith maintains that armor or weapon again.

MODIFY ARMOR

##Body text
While the field crafting of armor is often not possible, you can make smaller adjustments on the go. Over the course of 2 hours, you can turn a set of plate mail into a half plate or a breastplate, refit a set of heavy or medium armor to fit another user that is equal in size or smaller than the original user.

##Heading 2
MODIFY WEAPON

##Body text
Every adventure has slightly different preferences in their gear, and your skills allow you to make slight modifications to nonmagical weapons made of metal. These modifications take 2 hours, require a heat source, and require you to pass a DC 14 blacksmithing tool’s check (on failure, the weapon is damaged and has a −1 penalty to its attack rolls until fixed). You can perform one of the following modifications:

 • You can weight a weapon, giving it the heavy property. If it does not already have the two-handed property, it gains the two-handed property. • You can remove the heavy property from a weapon, reducing its damage dice by d2.

 • You can add the light property to a weapon without the heavy property, reducing its damage dice by d2.
##Bullet
 • You can silver the weapon (requires 5 silver scraps, doubled for two handed weapons).

REPAIR GEAR

##Body text
Sometime in the course of adventuring, weapons or armor will become severely damaged, suffering a penalty to its attack rolls or AC. Over the course of 2 hours, you can repair this damage, though at the discretion of the GM you may need other materials to perform this task if it is heavily damaged. Weapons that are entirely broken (such as a snapped sword) are generally beyond simple repair.

CUSTOM WEAPON GUIDE

##Body text
At first glance, it seems that the weapon selection in 5e is quite limited, but with a little knowledge of the system, you can largely expose that template that builds those weapons, and from there, well, the opportunities are limitless! When you would like to craft a template weapon, just follow the steps below:

##Heading 2
WEAPON CREATION TEMPLATE

##Body text
To create a weapon go through five steps to determine the final damage and properties of the weapon. Adding a d2 means increasing the die by one size (e.g. a d6 + d2 = d8) and the converse for subtracting a d2.

##Heading 2
STEP 1: SELECT ONE OF...

##Heading 2
##Body text
Property	Base Damage Die	Crafting Modifier	Material Modifier	Notes
##Body text
Simple	d6	12 Base DC	1 ingot	—
##Body text
Martial	d8	15 Base DC	3 ingots	Becomes a martial weapon

##Heading 2
STEP 2: SELECT ONE OF...

##Body text
Versatile	—	+1 Base DC	+1 ingot	+d2 when wielded with two hands
##Body text

STEP 3: SELECT ALL THAT APPLY...

##Body text
Reach	-d2	+2 Base DC	-1 ingot
##Body text
+1 long haft	—

Finesse	-d2	+3 Base DC	-1 ingot	No damage die cost if the weapon is light or has no other properties
##Body text
Thrown	—	+2 Base DC	—	—
##Body text
Heavy	+d2	+1 Base DC	+4 ingots	Requires two-handed

##Heading 2
STEP 4: SET DAMAGE DIE/DICE...

##Body text
You can divide your damage die into smaller dice that equal the same total. For example, a d12 can become 2d6 or be reduced again to 3d4. Each time you do this, the crafting Base DC increases by +1. You can’t divide dice to be lower than d4.

##Heading 2
STEP 5: SELECT DAMAGE TYPE...

Slashing	Deals Slashing Damage
##Body text
Piercing	Deals Piercing Damage
##Body text
Bludgeoning	Deals Bludgeoning Damage

BONUS STEP: MODIFIERS AND MATERIALS

##Body text
You can additionally add Material Modifiers and Crafting Modifiers to template weapons. These modifiers may add additional properties as listed by the modifier, and their difficult modifier is incorporated into the weapon.

Notes:

##Bullet
 • Thrown can be ranged weapons instead of melee weapons. (Example: Dart)
##Bullet
 • The GM can waive the restriction on heavy property requiring two-handed property but should be aware it opens the door to combining feats for great weapons with the use of shields.
##Bullet
 • Add one short haft for axes, maces or similar.
##Bullet
 • Weapons made of metal require a minimum of half an ingot (like a dagger), even if the table would reduce them zero.

BEYOND THE SYSTEM

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
While blacksmithing allows for a huge amount of custom creation, there will always be new things beyond the system.

##Body text
The following are some guidelines for how to make something beyond the system.

##Bullet
 • Trivial items should be composed of metal scraps and have a DC in the range of 8–12. These represent things blacksmiths can easily make. Common items should require ingots, and have a DC of 12–18 depending on if they are simple or exotic. Uncommon and rarer items should have uncommon and rarer materials matching their rarity.
##Bullet
 • Blacksmithing alone can make magical weapons only to the extent that magical components are used.
##Bullet
 • If you would like Blacksmithing alone to make fully magical swords, you can largely just take the materials from an equivalent enchanting recipe and add them to materials of the weapon, and then take the higher of the difficulty and crafting time of the projects.

Work Together and be Reasonable

##Body text
The system is, by its nature, extremely extensible. Great pains have been taken to make things as “balanced” as possible. But this doesn’t mean the rules transcend common sense. As a player, tell your GM what you want to make and be open to adjustments to how it would work. As a GM, tell players how their projects will work from the start, and be open to the idea they can make cool things... these crafted items are part of their “loot” and don’t need to be “power neutral” as long as they aren’t breaking anything.

COOKING

##Body text
Adventures need to eat. While some are content to eat the same stale old rations, some prefer to apply their skills to be kept well fed... even in the depths of a dungeon where fresh ingredients can be... strange.

##Body text
Not only can someone with talent produce tasty treats, but being well fed can have a variety of benefits... particularly when eating correctly prepared magical ingredients.

##Heading 2
RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

##Body text
Cooking works using cook’s utensils. Attempting to craft a meal without these will almost always be made with disadvantage, and proficiency with these allows you to add your proficiency to any cooking crafting roll. Cooking uses your Wisdom modifier.

##Heading 2
QUICK REFERENCE

##Body text
While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to make a meal in its most basic form: • Acquire a fresh ingredient by harvesting or finding it.

##Bullet
 • Review the Recipe Tables for Feasts, Snacks or Rations that ingredient would qualify for, and gather the other materials needed listed in the Materials column.
##Bullet
 • Use your cook’s utensils tool to craft the option using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or use the crafting camp action, during a long rest, if the crafting time is 2 hours or less. Meals must be crafted in a single crafting session. All meals require a heat source (such as a campfire).
##Bullet
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus with cook’s utensils. You can abort the craft after a bad crafting roll if you wish, this counts as a failure.
##Bullet
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the meal is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost, and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure, and all materials are lost.

##Heading 2
DURATION

##Body text
The duration a meal remains edible depends on the type of meal made. A feast must be consumed within an hour, a snack lasts for 1 day, and rations last 1 month.

##Heading 2
INGREDIENTS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
The materials for cooking are fresh ingredients and supplies. A fresh ingredient is something you harvest that can increase the quality of your food and sometimes provide supernatural boosts beyond mere satiation. Staples include seasonings, spices, flour or even turnips! Foods that last awhile can be cooked into perfectly fine meals but have less benefits than eating a good meal. Some ingredients additionally have the exotic property and may confer special effects.

##Heading 2
INGREDIENT EXPIRATION

##Body text
Normal Ingredients expire very quickly and must be used within 24 hours of being harvested or they become unusable. Preserved rations would fall into the staples category and cannot typically be used to cook anything besides basic meals.

##Body text
The ability to gain any sort of magical benefit is linked to its freshness; even well-prepared preserved foods provide only the benefit of a Basic Meal (which is a satisfying and good tasting meal, but its benefits are not otherwise magical).

##Body text
Unlike Fresh Ingredients, Staples last significantly longer and do not need to have their expiration tracked for the purposes of this system.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
General System, Specific Examples

##Body text
Like with all aspects, this crafting system does not attempt to provide systematic specific examples (though they are provided in the appendix), but rather a system that allows you to know the outcome of anything you could cook. For example, a party could acquire 1 common fresh ingredient by harvesting a Hook Horror, and then combine that with 1 common supplies to cook either Hook Turkey Sandwiches or Murder Chicken Tenders, but the benefit from either example would still fall into a Monstrosity Meat Quality Meal category (one step above standard rations).
### Layout: end frame

##Heading 2
SATIATION

##Body text
The magical benefits you get consuming rare and magical foods cannot be gained again until 24 hours have passed for any particular food. When combined with the ingredient expiration above, this typically means that any ingredient collected is only good for a single meal; this is intentional. You can harvest more if you wish, but cooking naturally is a profession of fleeting achievement and fickle opportunity.

##Heading 2
CRAFTING ROLL

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Putting that together means that when you would like to create a meal, your crafting roll is as follows:

##Body text
Cooking Modifier = your Cook’s Utensils proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

##Heading 2
SUCCESS AND FAILURE

##Body text
For cooking, all crafting rolls must be made consecutively. Make all checks listed for the items. If you succeed a greater number of times than you fail, the meal is successfully completed, otherwise, it is inedible, and all ingredients are lost.
### Layout: end frame

##Heading 2
EXOTIC INGREDIENTS

##Body text
While standard meals are made from a selection of ingredient types and generally a seasoning, exotic ingredients have specialized effects. When making a meal from these ingredients, the meal’s effect is a combination of the effect of the exotic ingredients added.

##Body text
An Exotic Meal (meal cooked entirely from exotic ingredients) doesn’t need a recipe and has a crafting time of 1 hour, and the difficulty is the difficulty of all the exotic ingredients added together, with 1 check needed per exotic ingredient added.

##Body text
Exotic ingredients can be combined with a standard meal by adding the DC of the standard meal to the combined difficulty of the exotic ingredients added. This can cause unusual meals and frequently has unattainably high difficulty to make it work, as adding random new components to meals typically wrecks the taste.

##Heading 2
BASIC COOKING & CAMP ACTIONS

##Body text
While the rules present a handful of ways to use cooking for more exotic ends, the most common application of cooking is just to produce an edible meal during a long rest—something any adventuring group would welcome. This is called a Quality Meal and provides greater benefit than rations, though the benefits it provides are not magical, and merely stem from it being a satisfying meal. You can do so by expending 1 fresh ingredient of any type and 1 common supply to feed up to 5 allies or willing creatures, or by spending common supplies per creature being cooked for. These materials must have been purchased within the last week. Any creature, even one not proficient with cook’s utensils, can take this action.

##Body text
You and all willing creatures (willing to eat your cooking) regain an additional Hit Die (up to their maximum). If you have proficiency with cook’s utensils, creatures regain additional Hit Dice equal to your Proficiency bonus.

HARVESTING INGREDIENTS

##Body text
Unlike other things, you can harvest from monsters, as there’s little chance of failure in harvesting. There’s generally more to harvest than meaningfully used. You can consume Monstrosity, Dragon, Beast and Plant Type creatures for magical benefits. However, your GM may allow other creature types as special delicacies at their discretion.

##Body text
Up to 5 creatures can consume this feast within an hour of it being prepared. After consuming this hearty meal, you become satiated for the next 24 hours. This is a hearty meal well surpassing the benefits of normal meals or rations, and each creature that consumes it regains an additional Hit Die during the next long rest.

##Body text
Up to 5 creatures can consume this feast within an hour of it being prepared. After consuming this hearty meal, you become satiated for the next 24 hours. You gain the benefits for a common feast but can gain additional benefits by trading in Hit Dice that would be gained as part of your next long rest after consuming this meal. These Hit Dice are consumed after calculating how many you would have after the rest (including the benefits of the feast), but you can trade Hit Dice in this way you would normally lose if you have more than your maximum Hit Dice.

##Body text
You can trade Hit Dice in this way up to a number equal to your proficiency bonus. The benefits scale is based on the rarity on the feast.

How Feast Spent Dice Work

##Body text
If, for example, at level 4, if you start a rest with 2 Hit Dice, and consume a meal that would give an additional Hit Die, you would end the rest with 5, but your maximum is 4, so you would lose the 5th. This allows you to spend that extra fifth Hit Die for additional benefits. You could spend 3 Hit Dice on these benefits, but doing so would mean you only have 2 Hit Dice after the long rest.

ENCHANTING

##Body text
Enchanting is a hard and expensive profession, but one eagerly pursued by many all the same. The makers of miracles, the craftsmen of wonder, no other profession holds the fascination of adventurers quite like Enchanter, for their domain encompasses the large majority of magical items.

##Body text
An item need not pass through an enchanter’s hands to be magical, indeed many a blacksmith has forged a magical blade with the right materials, but the true wonder of enchantment is to turn the mundane magical. An enchanter can turn even the most base and commonplace item into something wonderful and powerful, and when given the head start of working with an already well-crafted item can craft things of legend.

##Body text
Many enchanters further specialize in subdomains such as Scroll Scribing or Wand Whittling for more specialized good that require more specialized tools, with many even pursuing such things as Jewelry Crafting in order to create the precious items that most easily enchant, but the general field of Enchanting still covers a large swath of the wondrous.

##Body text
Scrolls are heavily featured as a component of nearly all magical items, forming the basis for the powerful enchantments that imbue them with their magic. These are templates of a sort, and thus the ability to craft scrolls with Scroll Scribing is often the most desired of the subdomains for an Enchanter.

##Heading 2
RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Rather than any one tool, Enchanting primarily uses the Arcana skill. Due to the subdomains of scrolls (Scroll Scribing) and runes (Runecraft) being part of enchanting, proficiency in Calligraphy Tools is often useful. 0

##Body text
Enchanting uses your Intelligence modifier. While magic comes in many forms (Arcane, Primal, Divine) and many casters are able to control it with other aspects of their talent, the ability to systematically bind it into magic items requires a deep understanding of its inner workings that can only be accomplished through meticulous study and knowledge.

Psionic Items

##Body text
The items listed on the Psionic Items table are the exception to this rule. These are items infused with psionic power, and instead use the “Psionics” skill, a skill that any psionic character can be considered proficient if not using special psionics rules.

##Body text
These items are something of a subtype of enchanting and may not exist in your setting if psionics aren’t included. Consult your GM.

##Heading 2
QUICK REFERENCE

##Body text
While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to make a magic item in its most basic form:

##Bullet
 • Select the magic item that you would like to craft from any of the Magic Item Tables.
##Bullet
 • Acquire the items listed in the materials column for that item.
##Bullet
 • Use your Arcana skill to infuse the option using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the crafting time is 2 hours or less.
##Bullet
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Intelligence modifier + your Arcana proficiency.
##Bullet
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the magic item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost, and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure, and all materials are lost.

##Heading 2
MATERIALS: ESSENCES & COMPONENTS

##Body text
The materials of enchanting are Essences and Components. Essences come in three different types: Arcane, Primal, and Divine—as well as five rarities: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary. What an Essence is can vary greatly, as they are things of innate magic that is used to power the Enchanter’s creations.

##Body text
They could be organs of magical monsters (such as the heart of a dragon which would be a rare primal essence) or they can be synthesized from magical reagents into a magical compound. Components are a broad category of items ranging from the base item you are enchanting to any extraneous bits needed to be added. One unique component that is present in many enchantments is a Spell Scroll of various types of spells that form the basis of the sort of the magic the item has.

##Heading 2
REPLACING SPELL SCROLLS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
A crafter that is capable of casting magic can replace the spell scroll in an enchantment with the ability to cast that spell, but when doing so they must cast that spell for each crafting check they make on that item. This is an exhausting process, draining their magic far more deeply than normal casting, and confers a level of exhaustion each time this technique is used to replace a crafting check. If a magic item requires multiple scrolls, only one of them can be replaced in this way, though if an additional spell caster that can cast the necessary spell can assist you, they can replace a second scroll, though suffering the same penalty.

##Body text
Exhausting & Difficult Method

##Body text
This mechanic is intentionally quite difficult to use—even for casters that are capable of casting the spell. The typical process would be to make the scroll first to formalize their thoughts and process, laying down the patterns and templates for the magic item. It also removes a very costly gate in the process, so should not be easily bypassed.

SUCCESS AND FAILURE

##Body text
After you make a crafting roll, if you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item).

##Body text
Checks for Enchanting do not need to be immediately consecutive. If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged. Failure means that no progress is made during that time.

##Body text
Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components reserved for that item can only be recovered via salvage.

Enchanting Example and Walkthrough

##Body text
Caius the Wizard has a keen interest in magic items. At the start, all he has is the Arcana skill and big dreams. Let’s walk through how turn those into a magic item.

##Body text
Caius the Wizard happens to be a level 4 wizard at this moment in time. Strangely, he’s the only human in his party, and his lack of darkvision has been holding them back.

##Body text
So, Caius decides to embark on making a set of Goggles of Night. Let’s follow his journey:

##Body text
First, he'll need to gather those materials. He needs googles, a scroll of darkvision, a common primal essence, and an uncommon arcane essence. Goggles are easily acquired from the local merchants for a few gold pieces, the rest will be a bit trickier.

##Body text
A common primal essence isn't that hard to come by, and can be found by harvesting elementals, dragons, giants, or monstrosities, even at the humble 0-4 CR rating of monsters Caius has been dealing with.

##Body text
The uncommon arcane essence will require a hunt. His party takes on a CR 5 undead, but on their d100, they roll a 64... no luck, all that was left was some mangled bones and 3 uncommon poisonous reagents. After a few more tries, it seems luck isn't with them. Fortunately, Caius has a plan. That uncommon poisonous reagent he got can be combined with an uncommon curative and uncommon reactive reagent in a simple 4-hour process with Alchemist's supplies and a head source.

##Body text
Boiling them all down, he's left with some magical residue forming an uncommon arcane essence. Now all he needs is the scroll of darkvision. Caius really should have had this spell long since given his darkvision shortcomings, but never got around to it.

##Body text
So, Caius shells out 90 gp to buy a scroll of it. Not to learn it though, of course, as soon he'll never need that spell again!

##Body text
All the pieces are assembled. As a level 4 Wizard with 16 Intelligence and proficiency in the Arcana skill, Caius Enchanting Modifier is 2 (his Arcana proficiency bonus) + 3 (his intelligence modifier), so is 5 total.

##Body text
During his next long rest, Caius makes his first crafting check, and rolls a d20! It's a 10. 10 + 5 = 15, so he has a success. He's 1/4th of the way done but needs to spend the rest of that long rest sleeping.

##Body text
The next day he rolls again, 6! That's only 11! One failure. The next night it's a 15 for a check of 20! That's a second success. Tragedy almost strikes with the next two checks being a 4 and 2, with results of 9 and 7 respectively, that's two more failures! All his hard work is on the edge of being lost.

##Body text
But Caius asks to take an extra-long break at the next town. He uses the 4 hours to make his next check, taking a 10 on the roll to forestall disaster. As he wasn't too ambitious and the Goggles of Night are only DC 13, that means by taking 10, Caius has a minimum check of a 15, and it's a pass. Feeling better, now that he's no longer one checked from the whole project failing, he makes his next check on the road, and gets an 18, for a total of 24. A fourth success, and he can take his watch that night with darkvision at long last...

##Body text
...unfortunately he'd been up too late working and fell asleep, so his party got ambushed anyway, but that's a story for another time!

##Body text
Caius the Wizard now can see in the dark as well as any pointy eared elf or long bearded dwarf! It took a bit longer than he'd hoped, but now Caius has his very first shiny magic item made by his own hands!

MAGIC ITEMS

ARCBLADE

##Body text
Weapon (longsword), very rare (requires attunement)

##Body text
This item appears to be a longsword hilt. While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to cause a blade of dark lightning to spring into existence, or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with shortswords or longswords, you are proficient with the arcblade.

##Body text
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals lightning damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit a creature with it, you can cause lightning to arc from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes 1d8 lightning damage.

##Body text
The arcblade is able to absorb ambient electrical energy to briefly enter a supercharged state. If you take lightning damage while this weapon’s blade is active, you can use your reaction to capture some of that energy and store it for up to 1 minute. The first time you hit with the arcblade before the end of the duration, the target takes additional lightning damage equal to half of the damage you took. This property can’t be used again until the next dusk.

BOARDING PARTY

##Body text
Weapon (any ammunition), uncommon

##Body text
This is a magical piece of ammunition carved with pirate motifs. This piece of ammunition changes size to fit the size of the weapon used (becoming large when loaded into a large weapon). You can use this piece of ammunition to cast translocating shot(B) once without expending a spell, targeting this piece of ammunition. Once used in this way, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

##Bullet
 • Item: Boarding Party (B)

##Heading 2
BOW OF MAGIC MISSILES

##Body text
Weapon (any bow), very rare (requires attunement by a creature that is proficient with shortbows or longbows)

##Body text
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, it has 5 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 charge as an action and draw the bowstring, causing two gleaming arrows of magical force to materialize. You immediately fire each arrow at a creature that you can see within 600 feet of you. You can direct the arrows at one creature or multiple, and each arrow automatically hits its target, striking simultaneously.

##Body text
You can choose to expend additional charges as part of the same action to fire one extra arrow per charge expended. Each arrow deals force damage equal to 1d6 + your proficiency bonus. The bow regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the bow’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the bow retains its +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses all other properties.

##Body text
Armor (breastplate), very rare (requires attunement)

##Body text
You have a +1 bonus to AC and advantage on saving throws to resist being frightened while wearing this armor.

##Body text
This armor has 3 charges, which it regains daily at dawn. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to cast the warding bond spell or 2 charges to cast the faithful hound spell from the armor without requiring material components. When warding bond is cast in this way, a spectral golden retriever appears next to the creature you are bonded with and follows it dutifully. The golden retriever is incorporeal, and it can shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet upon the bonded creature’s request (no action required).

##Body text
Multiple pockets are hidden on the inside of the coat, able to conceal small objects. A creature attempting to search your person must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check in order to discover the hidden pockets.

##Body text
Sailor’s Mouth. Once per short or long rest, you can use a bonus action to cast the vicious mockery spell (save DC 15) while wearing the coat. When cast in this way, the target takes extra psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

##Bullet
 • Item: Captain's Coat (B)

CASCADE CATALYST

##Body text
Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)

##Body text

##Heading 2
CRYSTAL KEY

##Body text
Wondrous item, very rare

##Body text
An intricate crystalline doorknob with intricate carved patterns. This crystal contains a psionically constructed space that can be manifested by placing it against any flat vertical surface large enough for a Medium-sized door to appear on and speaking the command word. It creates a door that leads into this interdimensional space. The size of this space depends on the size of the object the doorknob is placed again. If the space is at least 10 feet long by 10 feet wide, it creates a simply furnished bedroom with a bed, light, chair, and desk. The atmosphere in the room is comfortable and the air is breathable.

##Body text
For each additional 10 cubic feet of space in the object the doorknob is placed in, additional rooms appear, in the following order:

##Bullet
 • A bathroom furnished with wash tub and running water (the water is potable).
##Bullet
 • A comfortable study furnished with a writing table, chair, bookshelves and fireplace.
##Bullet
 • A workshop with basic artisan tools and work benches.
##Bullet
 • A kitchen that contains no food, but all basic cooking tools, and an always hot oven.
##Bullet
 • Additional bedrooms, up to four additional rooms.
##Bullet
 • Anything created by the extradimensional space can’t leave the extradimensional space.

##Body text
These rooms are extradimensional and do not truly exist within the object and can’t be accessed by any means other than through the door (they do not structurally affect the object, or allow you to access entrances or areas within the object).

##Bullet
 • Item: Crystal Key (B)

##Heading 2
CRYSTAL BALL OF THIEVING

##Body text
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)

##Body text
This crystal ball is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (save DC 17) with it.

##Body text
You can use an action to cast the mage hand spell while you are scrying with the crystal ball, the spectral hand appearing within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. When cast in this way you can make the spectral hand invisible. When the scrying ends, so does the spell, and any object held by the spectral hand is teleported into your open hand or to an unoccupied space at your feet. Teleporting an object via this method is unreliable and has a chance to fail. Roll a d20 to determine if you are successful. If you have had physical contact with the object before add 5 to your roll. If the object has spent more than 24 hours in your possession, add 10. The DC is 15. On a failure, the object reappears in the space that it occupied before the spectral hand interacted with it, or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is now occupied. Once used, the thieving power of the crystal ball can’t be used again until the next dawn.

##Body text
Curse. Each time you successfully steal an item using this crystal ball, the owner of the item immediately sees an image of your face and hears your name in their mind. They don’t necessarily know the context, but if your theft arouses suspicion, it’s a likely deduction that you are related to the disappearance of their possession.

##Bullet
 • Item: Crystal Ball of Thieving (B)

##Heading 2
DAGGER OF THE OGRE MAGE

##Body text
Weapon (shortsword), uncommon (requires attunement)

##Body text
This blade was once used as a dagger by an ogre mage but is nevertheless large enough to be a shortsword. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

##Body text
This blade’s hilt is hollow and can hold up to 3 cantrip spell scrolls. Cantrip scrolls left within the compartment for 1 minute activate one of the three clear gems adorning its grip. Once activated, you can cast these cantrips at will using your spellcasting modifier. If you don’t have a spellcasting modifier, use your Intelligence modifier instead. You have proficiency with these cantrips. Cantrips cast from the blade use the weapon as an arcane focus and allow you to perform any somatic components with the weapon instead of requiring a free hand. Scrolls contained within the sword are not destroyed after using them in this way.

##Body text
When you cast a cantrip using the sword that deals damage, the sword’s damage type changes to match the cantrip’s for 1 minute or until you end it early (no action required).

##Bullet
 • Item: Dagger of the Ogre Mage (B)

##Heading 2
DARK FATHOM ARMOR

##Body text
Armor (studded leather), very rare (requires attunement)

##Body text
This dark, sea-soaked suit of armor smells of brine and is covered in eldritch runes. You have a +1 bonus to AC and can breathe normally underwater while wearing this armor.

##Body text
In addition, while wearing this armor, you can use an action to cast the black tentacles spell (save DC 15) from it. When cast in this way, the spell targets a 15-foot square centered on your location that does not follow you when you move. In addition, you do not need to concentrate on the spell and are immune to its effects when cast in this way. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dusk.

##Bullet
 • Item: Dark Fathom Armor (B)

##Heading 2
DECOMBOBULATOR

##Body text
Wondrous item, rare

##Body text
This small mysterious device can emit a projected field within 5 feet of it that heats matter until it undergoes a state change, from a solid to a liquid, or from a liquid to a gas. It has no effect on gas. The target area is always in the shape of a cube and can be as small as a 1-inch cube or as large as a 5-foot cube. The process takes 1 minute. If a creature ends its turn in the projected field, it takes 2d6 fire damage. This damage doubles each consecutive turn it ends in the area. This damage is also taken by any creature attempting to hold or touch something in the area of effect.

DOODLE RING

##Body text
Ring, common

##Body text
This magic wooden ring is always covered in splotches of charcoal, ink, or paint, regardless of how well or often it’s cleaned. While wearing the ring on a finger, you can touch that finger to a solid surface and begin to draw. The drawing uses your finger to make marks as if it were a piece of charcoal, ink quill, or paintbrush (your choice). The marks you make can be in any color. Any drawing made by the ring can be easily smudged or washed away without leaving any marks behind. The ring can have up to a total of 5 square feet covered with drawings in this way at any time. Drawing more than that begins to erase the previous marks, and any mark left after 24 hours of being made is magically erased.

DRAGON TAMER LANCE

##Body text
Weapon (lance), legendary (requires attunement)

##Body text
This slender, iridescent lance is covered in an enchanted finish that resembles the hardened scales of many dragons. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While attuned to the weapon, you can understand and speak Draconic.

##Body text
This lance has 8 charges and regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges each day at dawn. When you hit a target with the lance, you can expend 1 of its charges to deal an extra 3d6 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage (your choice) to the target. If you expend a charge in this way when you hit a dragon, it must also succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the beginning of your next turn. For the purpose of this weapon, “dragon” refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.

##Body text
Whenever you expend a charge in this way to deal extra damage, you can choose to expend a 2nd charge and deal an extra 1d6 damage of the same type to the target and prevent it from using its reaction until the start of its next turn.

##Body text
Wyrmling Steed. In addition, while holding the lance, you can use an action to cast the find steed spell from it. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn. When you use the lance to cast this spell, you can choose to summon a dragon wyrmling instead of a normal mount by expending a number of charges equal to its challenge rating (maximum 2). You determine the kind of dragon summoned, although its alignment towards good or evil must be the same as your own. If your alignment is neutral, you can summon a wyrmling of either alignment. The wyrmling counts as one size larger when used as a mount and cannot use its breath weapons.

##Body text
Forceful Impact. If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a Medium or smaller target and then make a melee attack with the lance against it while within 5 feet of the target, you make the attack with advantage instead of disadvantage. If you hit, you can immediately roll to attack another target 5 feet directly behind the first, without advantage, as part of the initial attack.

A segmented metallic whip that crackles with lightning. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic whip, and it deals an extra 1d4 lightning damage on hit.

##Body text
This whip is highly articulated and can move with surgical precision, allowing it to serve as an extended reach for certain tasks. As an action, you can attempt to grapple a creature, entangling with the whip. When you do so, you can make a Dexterity (Athletics) check to initiate and maintain the grapple (instead of Strength). A creature that starts its turn while grappled with this whip takes 1d4 lightning damage.

HERO’S SHEATH

##Body text
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a paladin)

##Body text
An ornate sheath built for a longsword; this sheath infuses a blade stored within with divine power. When you draw a weapon stored in this sheath, the first attack you make with it after drawing it forth has a range of 30/60 (using the weapons normal attack modifier) and deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage.

##Body text
If you expend a spell slot to empower this special attack using your Divine Smite feature, the blade emits a holy blast that deals damage equal to the Divine Smite targeting all creatures within 15 feet. The range of the cone increases by 15 feet for each level of spell slot expended on the Divine Smite. The target of the attack takes the Divine Smite damage as normal if the attack hits, while all other creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 16. On failure, they take radiant damage equal to the damage dice of the Divine Smite damage (this is not doubled if the attack is a critical hit), or half as much damage on a successful saving throw.

##Body text
A longsword that is sheathed in this sheath for at least 24 hours is infused with divine power. Its damage die is increased by one step (from a d8 to a d10, and its versatile damage from a d10 to a d12) and it counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance to damage. This bonus lasts until another weapon is sheathed in this scabbard.

This is a special holy symbol often belonging to the order of a god dedicated to knowledge or magic, imbued with special power by the god or their agents with the ability to confer arcane magic to a disciple.

##Body text
When an attuned user is preparing spells for the day, they can prepare spells from the wizard spell list in addition to the cleric spell list, but any spell prepared in this way is prepared at one level higher than it normally would be. For example, if they were to use this holy symbol to prepare the fireball spell from the wizard list, it would be prepared as if were normally a 4th-level spell (not gaining benefits from being up-cast as a 4th-level spell).

This barbed javelin embeds itself into creatures and hinders their movement. A creature hit by this javelin has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the javelin is removed. While you are within 120 feet of the javelin and you can see it, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word, causing the javelin to viciously remove itself from the target and fly back to your open hand or to an unoccupied space at your feet. You can choose to remove the javelin as a part of the attack while wielding it in melee. Alternatively, any creature can remove the javelin with an action. When the javelin is removed, the barbs deal an extra 1d6 piercing damage to the creature.

LOST ERA EMANATOR

##Body text
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

##Body text
This ancient device is fueled by a mysterious power source. It hums to life and glows softly when held. The device’s arcane design is nearly inscrutable and requires careful examination to decipher its function. In order to attune to the device, you must first succeed on a DC 16 Arcana check, otherwise the attunement fails, and you can’t attempt it again for 24 hours.

##Body text
The device has 12 charges. While holding it, you can use the attack action to emit a ray of concentrated heat from the device, expending 1 charge for each attack. The device functions as a ranged weapon with the ammunition and two-handed properties, a normal range of 60 feet, and a long range of 240 feet. While you are attuned to it, you can add your proficiency bonus to attack rolls with the device. Additionally, when you attack with the device, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Dexterity, for the attack rolls. The device deals 3d8 fire damage (this damage doesn’t benefit from ability score modifiers) to any target it hits.

##Body text
As an action, you can expend 3 charges to fire a supercharged ray from the device. The ray is 90 feet long and 6 inches wide. Any creature within this area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw and take 8d8 fire damage on a failure, or half damage on a success. This ray is able to penetrate through 1 inch of metal, 6 inches of stone, or 1 foot of wood, leaving a scorched hole 6 inches in diameter.

##Body text
The device regains charges by storing arcane energy. Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 6th level into the device by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the device. If the device can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The device regains 1 charge for each level of spell slot used.

THEURGE’S LIBRUM

##Body text
Wondrous items, very rare (requires attunement by a wizard)

##Body text
This hefty ornate spell book remains pristine in all conditions, its cover depicting detailed sacred inscriptions. After studying the contents of this book for 8 hours, the user can comprehend a unifying theory of divine and arcane power, though such a comprehension mystically fades from the mind if they ever lose possession or un-attune from the librum, until they are once more in possession and attuned to the librum.

##Body text
When found, the librum contains the following spells: cure wounds, bless, lesser restoration, gentle repose, revivify, spirit guardians, commune, guardian of faith, dawn, and mass cure wounds. The spells contained within can be prepared as Wizard spells for the attuned user but can’t be copied out of the spell book. Casting these divine spells exerts a special strain on a wizard, however, and they can only cast a total number of spell slots of spells that do not appear on the Wizard list from this book equal to their Wizard level, after which they must finish a long rest, refreshing the number of spells they can cast.

##Body text
In addition, it contains 10 empty pages, each of which can contain one additional spell from the cleric list. If you come across a cleric spell in written form (such as a scroll) the spell can be permanently copied into the librum, expending one of the empty pages. The process of copying the spell into your ritual book takes 2 hours per level of the spell, and costs 50 gp per level. The cost represents the material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.

QUICK REFERENCE

##Body text
While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to make a scroll in its most basic form:

##Bullet
 • Select a spell you know that you would like to craft from spells you are able to cast, or through Alternate Methods (see “Magic Formula”).
##Bullet
 • Acquire the items listed in the materials column for a scroll of that level and type.
##Bullet
 • Use your Calligraphy Tools to write the scroll using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the crafting time is 2 hours or less.
##Bullet
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency with Calligraphy Tools (if you have proficiency in the Arcana skill)
##Bullet
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the magic item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost, and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure, and all materials are lost.

The materials for Scrollscribing are Ink and Parchment. Ink and Parchment used in scrolls is typically purchased, and below are the price tables. Some types of rare parchment may be processed from rare alchemical ingredients by an alchemist or from the hides of magical creatures by a leatherworker. If they are found as part of treasure, they are calculated as any other precious non-currency treasure would be calculated.

##Body text
The ink used to create scrolls must be a special formulation that allows it to contain the magical essence behind the glyphs, script, runes, and words that make up a magical scroll. This ink is created by alchemists, but can be purchased at the below rates:

SUCCESS AND FAILURE

##Body text
After making a crafting roll, if you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item).

##Body text
Checks for Scrollscribing do not need to be immediately consecutive. If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged. Failure means that no progress is made during that time.

##Body text
Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components reserved for that item can only be recovered via salvage.

CRAFTING WITHOUT ESSENCE

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
A crafter that is capable of casting magic can replace the essence when crafting a spell scroll with the ability to cast that spell, but when doing so they must cast that spell for each crafting check they make on that item. This is an exhausting process, draining their magic far more deeply than normal casting, and confers a level of exhaustion for each crafting check made this way.

MAGICAL FORMULA

##Body text
To craft a spell scroll, you must know the Magic Formula of the spell you want to make a Spell Scroll of. The easiest way to do this is to be able to cast the spell. You always know the Magic Formula of a spell you know how to cast. Otherwise, you need to have deep knowledge of the spell to be able to make a scroll of it. The following are some ways you can gain that knowledge:

##Bullet
 • Have it in your spellbook as a Wizard.
##Bullet
 • Have it in your spell manual as an Infusionsmith Inventor.
##Bullet
 • Have it in your ritual book as a ritual caster.
##Bullet
 • Have a spell scroll of it (DC +2)
##Bullet
 • Study its magical formula and record it. To learn a spell in this way requires proficiency in arcana and 1 day (8 hours per day) of study per level of the spell, as well as access to a teacher or book that records the spell. Once learned, you can record it in a Magical Formula book and can subsequently make scrolls of it.

SCROLL ESSENCE TYPE

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

The type of Essence is determined by the spell list the spell comes from; if it is on multiple spell lists, it is determined by how you have access to the spell.

Wand Whittling

##Heading 2
WAND WHITTLING

##Body text
Unlike many magic items that are crafted and then enchanted with magic, a wand is purpose built to store the magic it will contain, worked from wood and infused with magic as a single process, with different intricacies based on the type of magic it will wield.

##Body text
Wands are very valuable to adventurers, and the power they wield should never be underestimated, as they can save precious resources. While the typical wand is an attunement item that can recharge, there is a weaker variety of lesser wands that are consumable items, more akin to multi-use scrolls that are easier to make.

##Heading 2
RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

##Body text
Wand whittling works using Woodcarver’s tools. Attempting to craft a wand without these is impossible.

##Body text
The related ability score is Dexterity. While spellcasters of any stripe can make wands of the spells they know, the process is one of systematic application of magical theory to integrate the spell into a wand in a function that can later be used.

##Body text
Additionally, like Scroll Scribing and Enchanting, proficiency in Arcana is required; without proficiency in arcana, you can’t add your Tool proficiency to the crafting roll.

##Heading 2
QUICK REFERENCE

##Body text
While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you at a glance to follow the steps to make a wand in its most basic form:

##Bullet
 • Select a wand from the Greater Wand Table you would like to make, or a spell you would like to make a Lesser Wand of.
##Bullet
 • Acquire the items listed in the materials column for a Wand from the appropriate table.
##Bullet
 • Use your Woodcarver’s tools to create the wand using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the crafting time is 2 hours or less.
##Bullet
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency with Woodcarver’s tools. On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the wand is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost, and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure, and all materials are lost.

##Heading 2
MATERIALS: WOOD & ESSENCE

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
The materials for Wand Whittling are wood and essences. The wood used in wands is typically purchased, and below are the table of prices. If they are found as part of treasure, they are calculated as any other precious non-currency treasure would be calculated. Low-level wands can use common woods that are not magically attuned, but more powerful magic will cause such mundane wood to instantly splinter or catch fire, requiring the use of rare and exotic woods.

##Body text
Essences are varied in nature but are what power wands. Essences are shared with Enchanting, and more details can be gleaned from the Essences section under Enchanting.

What Are Rare Woods?

##Body text
The most common examples would be from trees in exotic locations—wood from the Feywild or from the outer planes. The exact nature of the wands can match the spell for flavor, but the details beyond rarity are not considered by default for the system. Some examples are provided at the end of this section.

PURCHASING WOODEN BRANCHES

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Like with many materials, one popular method of acquisition is to simply spend gold. A piece of wood here is typically a branch about 2–3 feet long and moderately narrow, suitable for a wand with some whittling.

SUCCESS AND FAILURE

##Body text
For Wand Whittling, after you make the crafting roll and succeed, mark your progress on a crafting project. If you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item). Checks for Wand Whittling do not need to be immediately consecutive. Failure means that no progress is made during that time. As usual, failing three times in a row results in the crafting project being a failure, and all materials are lost.
### Layout: end frame

##Heading 2
WAND WHITTLING SAVING THROW

##Body text
Some wands require a saving throw, the following is the formula for calculating the saving throw. The saving throw is calculated at the time of creation based on the creator’s attributes and proficiency, and doesn’t change once it is created. A saving throw doesn’t include any expertise or other bonuses a crafter has to the crafting roll.

##Body text
Wand DC = 8 + your related tool proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

##Heading 2
LESSER & GREATER WANDS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Many adventurers are most familiar with greater wands, forged with such skill and power that their power regenerates each day at dawn, providing nearly unlimited ability to wield magic. These are, however, the rarer exception: Greater Wands. Their weaker cousins (Lesser Wands) work in a similar fashion, but do not naturally recharge, and must be recharged to be used again.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

##Heading 2
RECHARGING LESSER WANDS

##Body text
Recharging lesser wands is fairly simple; you can either expend 1 essence of the rarity required to craft that wand and perform a ritual that takes 2 hours, expending the essence and restoring all charges to the Lesser Wand (this only works with Lesser Wands), or you can expend 2 spell slots equal to the level of the spell the wand can cast (1st level for cantrip) during this ritual to recharge a single charge; you can repeat this ritual to recharge the wand multiple times, up to its maximum charges.
### Layout: end frame

##Heading 2
MAGICAL FORMULA

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
For Greater Wands, they have known formulas that can be deduced as part of crafting (as with Enchanting), and you do not need to know the spell or effect before crafting the Wand, though they are typically harder to craft.

##Body text
To craft a Lesser Wand, you must know the Magic Formula of the spell you want to make a Lesser Wand of. The easiest way to do this is to be able to cast the spell. You always know the Magic Formula of a spell you know how to cast. Otherwise, you need to have deep knowledge of the spell to be able to make a Lesser Wand of it. The following are some ways you can gain that knowledge:

##Bullet
 • Have it in your spellbook as a Wizard.
##Bullet
 • Have it in your spell manual as an Infusionsmith Inventor.
##Bullet
 • Have it in your ritual book as a ritual caster.
##Bullet
 • Have a spell scroll of it (DC +2)
##Bullet
 • Study its magical formula and record it. To learn a spell in this way requires proficiency in arcana and 1 day (8 hours per day) of study per level of the spell, as well as access to a teacher or book that records the spell. Once learned, you can record it in a Magical Formula book and can subsequently make scrolls of it.

##Heading 2
LESSER WAND ESSENCE TYPE

##Body text
The type of Essence is determined by the spell list the spell comes from; if it is on multiple spell lists, it is determined by how you have access to the spell. If you have access to the spell via multiple lists or the written form of the spell, you can pick which Essence to use for spells that have multiple options.

This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the spell infused in it it. For 1 charge, you cast the base version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend (if applicable for the spell). The DC of the spell is crafter’s Wand DC.

##Body text
The wand doesn’t regain charges naturally but can be recharged (see recharge rules for Lesser Wands).

LEATHERWORKING

##Body text
Leatherworking is often seen as something of the “light armor” equivalent to a blacksmith, but it covers quite a bit more ground than that. While it may be the unsung hero, an adventurer’s best friend is a study leather backpack. Backpacks, belts, waterskins, quivers and more all fall to these artisans to make and can prove essential to everyday life.

##Body text
In addition to their more mundane wares, however, leather, hide, scales, and carapaces of monsters in the fantastical settings these craftsmen find themselves in often provide more opportunity than the basic components of mundane items. A leatherworker is essential if you wish to get the most mileage out of your harvested monsters.

##Heading 2
QUICK REFERENCE

##Body text
While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to work items from leather:

##Bullet
 • Select the item that you would like to craft from any of the Leatherworking Crafting Tables.
##Bullet
 • Acquire the items listed in the materials column for that item.
##Bullet
 • Use your leatherworker’s tools to craft the option using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the crafting time is 2 hours or less.
##Bullet
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Dexterity + your proficiency bonus with leatherworker’s tools.
##Bullet
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time toward the total crafting time.
##Bullet
 • On failure, the crafting time is lost, and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure, and all materials are lost.

LEATHER ITEMS

##Heading 2
LEATHER BUCKLER

##Body text
Shield, common

##Body text
A small, simple, and light shield. Wielding this shield increases your armor class by 1. You can benefit from only one shield at a time. You can hold items in the same hand as this light buckler, but any weapon wielded with the same hand has disadvantage on weapon attacks, and any grappling attempts with that hand are made with disadvantage.

##Bullet
 • Item: Leather Buckler (B)

##Heading 2
SCOURGE

##Body text
Weapon, common

##Body text
This heavy metal-tipped whip is a martial weapon with the reach property. It deals 2d4 slashing damage on a hit. Due to its unwieldy nature, you have disadvantage when you use a scourge to attack a target within 5 feet of you.

##Bullet
 • Item: Scourge (B)

##Heading 2
THROWING BANDOLIER

##Body text
Adventuring gear, common

##Body text
This is a quick access bandolier that can old weapons with the thrown property. It can be configured to hold 2 javelins, handaxes, or light hammers, or 4 daggers or darts. Weapons held in it can be drawn as part of making an attack with them without using an object interaction to draw them as long as you have a free hand to draw them.

Tinkering

##Heading 2
TINKERING

##Body text
Tinkering is applying creativity to junk to make new things. Sometimes even useful new things. Ranging from the humble crafts to complex contraptions, tinkering is a broad category that any adventuring party can benefit from.

##Body text
Oft the purview of peddlers and wanderers, they have a broad skill set and tend to excel at working with limited resources and their wit rather than expensive shopping lists of materials, though many will say they have a bad habit of collecting too much junk with the idea that things can be handy when you would least expect it...

##Heading 2
QUICK REFERENCE

##Body text
While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to tinker up an item in its most basic form:

##Bullet
 • Select the item that you would like to craft from any of the Tinkering Crafting Tables.
##Bullet
 • Acquire the items listed in the materials column for that item.
##Bullet
 • Use your tinker’s tools to craft the option using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the crafting time is 2 hours or less.
##Bullet
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Intelligence + your proficiency bonus with tinker’s tools.
##Bullet
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost, and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure, and all materials are lost.

##Heading 2
RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

##Body text
Tinkering works using tinker’s tools. Attempting to tinker item without these will almost always be made with disadvantage, and proficiency with these allows you to add your proficiency in them to any Tinkering crafting roll.

##Body text
Most of the time tinkers need only the minimal heat of a basic fire and their tools to work, though any craft that requires an ingot may require a forge at the discretion of the GM.

##Heading 2
MATERIALS: PARTS & SCRAP

##Body text
Tinkering uses metal scraps, miscellaneous parts (simply referred to as “parts”), and, in cases of making more magically functional things, essences to imbue them with their power. The term “parts” is used to refer to gears, wires, springs, windy bits, screws, nails, and doodads. Parts can be either found or salvaged or forged from metal scraps (or even straight from ingots by a Blacksmith for those that really want to be industrial about it). The exact nature of each item making up this collection is left abstracted.

##Body text
In addition, metal scraps are collections of salvaged material that generally fall into the category of things “too small to track” which can then be used for the creations of tinkerers. In addition to all of this, occasionally tinkers will use ingots... particularly ones of tin (which is their namesake, after all).

##Body text
Like other crafting branches, there are also named components for more iconic pieces of gear—the stock of a crossbow, for example, or other items. The cost for these items can be found on the common component table and are generally minor.

##Body text
Lastly, Tinkerers use essences when constructing things that push beyond the mundane principles of plausibility, crafting magical properties into their inventions.

##Body text
Named Components

##Body text
In almost all cases, named components (such as a “wooden stock” for a crossbow) can be simply abstracted out as a minor cost, but, as always, the level of abstraction is up to the GM.

##Heading 2
CRAFTING ROLL

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Putting that together means that when you would like to smith an item, your crafting roll is as follows:

##Body text
Tinkering Modifier = your Tinker’s Tools proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

##Heading 2
SUCCESS AND FAILURE

##Body text
For Tinkering, after you make the crafting roll and succeed, mark your progress on a crafting project. If you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item). Checks for Tinkering do not need to be immediately consecutive. Failure means that no progress is made during that time. Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components reserved for that item can only be recovered via salvage.

##Body text
If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged.
### Layout: end frame

##Heading 2
TINKERING SAVING THROW

##Body text
Some gadgets a Tinkerer creates require a saving throw, the following is the formula for calculating the saving throw. The saving throw is calculated at the time of creation based on the creator’s attributes and proficiency and doesn’t change once it is created. A saving throw doesn’t include any expertise or other bonuses a crafter has to the crafting roll.

##Body text
Tinkering DC = 8 + your Tinker’s Tools proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

WHISTLING SHOT

##Body text
Weapon (ammunition), common

##Body text
When fired, this shot emits a shrill whistle that can be heard from up to 500 feet from where it is fired and its target point.

RAPID-FIRE HEAVY CROSSBOW

##Body text
This lever-action heavy crossbow is auto-drawing and magazine-fed. A revolving cylinder ringed with magnetic chambers grabs and nocks bolts from the magazine to be fired in rapid succession.

##Body text
This crossbow lacks the loading property and is fitted with a cartridge that can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts. It automatically reloads after firing until the cartridge runs out of ammunition. Reloading the cartridge takes 1 minute.

##Body text
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you use the Attack action with this crossbow, you can use a bonus action to attack again with it.

##Bullet
 • Item: Rapid-Fire Heavy Crossbow

##Heading 2
LANTERN SHIELD

##Body text
This bizarre buckler has a lantern, a gauntlet, defensive spikes, and a short sword built into it. You must wear the gauntlet in order to wield it, and it only grants a +1 bonus to AC. The bullseye lantern concealed within the shield casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. The aperture that sheds light through the shield can be opened or closed with a bonus action while wearing the gauntlet, instantly igniting or extinguishing the lantern.

##Body text
While the lantern is covered and you are attacked in darkness by a creature within 60 feet of you that is also in darkness, you can reveal the light (no action required) to momentarily blind the attacker, imposing disadvantage on the attack. A creature can’t be blinded in this way again for 24 hours.

##Body text
If a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4 piercing damage to the attacker with the shield’s defensive spikes.

##Body text
Additionally, the shield has a shortsword built into it that can be wielded while wearing the gauntlet. You can deploy or retract it with a bonus action. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this shortsword and you are proficient with this weapon if you are proficient with shields. Attacks with this weapon are made with disadvantage if you are holding a weapon without the light property, or an object longer than 1 foot or heavier than 5 pounds in your gauntlet hand.

##Bullet
 • Item: Lantern Shield

##Heading 2
ORDINARY WALKING STICK

##Body text
You can use a bonus action to twist the shaft of this quarterstaff and deploy or retract the limbs of a light crossbow built into its head. It is indistinguishable from a walking stick while the limbs are retracted. It functions as a quarterstaff in either mode, however it only functions as a crossbow when the limbs are deployed. This crossbow lacks the loading property and is fitted with an internal magazine that can hold up to six crossbow bolts. It automatically reloads after firing until the magazine runs out of ammunition. Reloading the magazine takes an action. You are proficient with this magical weapon if you are proficient in either light crossbows or quarterstaffs.

Woodcarving

##Heading 2
WOODCARVING

##Body text
Woodcarving is the branch of crafting concerned with creating objects from wood, primarily working with branches to carve bows, musical instruments, and some simple armor. A simple branch of crafting, it provides many of an adventurer's common necessities, particularly for those with more ranged styles. A good woodcarver never fears running out of arrows and can find their materials quite readily.

##Heading 2
QUICK REFERENCE

##Body text
While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to work items from leather.

##Bullet
 • Select the item that you would like to craft from any of the Woodcarving Tables.
##Bullet
 • Acquire the items listed in the materials column for that item.
##Bullet
 • Use your woodcarver’s tools to craft the option using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the crafting time is 2 hours or less.
##Bullet
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Dexterity + your proficiency bonus with woodcarver’s tools.
##Bullet
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost, and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure, and all materials are lost.

##Heading 2
RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

##Body text
Woodworking works using woodcarver’s tools. Attempting to craft items with Woodworking without these will almost always be made with disadvantage, and proficiency with these allows you to add your proficiency in them to any Woodworking crafting roll.

##Heading 2
MATERIALS: WOOD

##Body text
Woodworking is a bit more straight forward than other types of crafting in that it primarily has only category of material: wood. This can come in several different form factors, but is measured in branches, consistent pieces of useful wood.

##Heading 2
SUCCESS AND FAILURE

##Body text
For Woodworking, after you make the crafting roll and succeed, mark your progress on a crafting project. If you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item). Checks for Woodworking do not need to be immediately consecutive. Failure means that no progress is made during that time. Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components are reserved for that item.
### Layout: end frame

##Heading 2
CARVED BRANCHES

##Body text
Woodworkers can increase the rarity of a branch through expert carving techniques. A wooden branch of higher quality produced through woodcarving can’t be used as the material to make a branch of even higher rarity, but otherwise a carved branch serves as a branch of their finished rarity for crafting (such as enchanting or other woodworking items that call for a branch of that rarity).

##Body text
Effectively, carving the branch can only increase the rarity of a branch by one step.

RUNECARVING

##Body text
Runecarving is the art of marking special magical enhancements in the form of magical runes. These are symbolic representations that channel and focus power to confer a special magical effect to the item they are marked on.

##Heading 2
QUICK REFERENCE

##Body text
The following is a quick reference to follow for each step of carving runes:

##Bullet
 • Select a basic item you would like to mark a rune on. This can be an mundane item, gem, nonmagical weapon, or nonmagical armor.
##Bullet
 • Select a rune you would like to mark on that item from the table based on the item type.
##Bullet
 • Acquire the materials listed in the materials column for that rune.
##Bullet
 • Use your Related Tool (based on your Runecraving tradition) to craft the option using the number of hours listed in the crafting time column. You can make progress in 2 hour increments.
##Bullet
 • For every 2 hour increment, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Wisdom or Intelligence (based on your Tradition) + your Proficiency bonus with your related tool.
##Bullet
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail three times in a row, the crafting is a failure and all materials are lost.

##Heading 2

### Layout: end frame

##Heading 2
RUNECARVING SAVING THROW

##Body text
Some runes require a saving throw, the following is the formula for calculating the saving throw. The saving throw is calculated at the time of creation based on the creators attributes and proficiency, and doesn't change once it is created. A saving throw doesn't include any expertise or other bonuses a crafter has to the crafting roll.

##Body text
Rune DC = 8 + your related tool proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Intelligence modifier (based on your Tradition).

##Body text
Rune Attack Roll Modifier = your related tool proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Intelligence modifier (based on Tradition).

##Heading 2
PLACING A RUNE

##Body text
You can place a rune a nonmagical weapon, set of armor, or item. When you place an rune on an item, that item requires attunement. When a creature is attuned to it, the rune grants the wielder certain benefits as defined by the rune. An item becomes a magical item of the rarity of the rune placed on it when a rune is palced on it

##Heading 2
RUNES ON MAGICAL ITEMS

##Body text
Placing a rune on a magical item is exceedingly difficult. Magical items resist modification, and their magic interfers with the rune. It can be done with additional difficult as per the table below. If the item has attunement, the rune still requires seperate attunement.

Engineering

##Heading 2
ENGINEERING

##Body text
Engineering is an academic art of turning labor and materials into grand creations. At its smallest scale, it is used for pratical applications like siege equipment, but scales up to building bridges, buildings, and even ships. An engineer is a deeply sought after resource for any lord or kingdom, but has knowledge that savvy adventurers can put to great use on occasion.

##Heading 2
RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

##Body text
Engineering uses carpenter's tools. Checks can be made with a substitute tool at your GM's discretion, but are made with disadvantage.

##Heading 2
QUICK REFERENCE

##Body text
The following is a quick reference to follow for each step of an engineering project:

##Bullet
 • Select the construction project you would like to begin.
##Bullet
 • Gather the required labor if necessary.
##Bullet
 • Ensure you have all materials for the construction project available.
##Bullet
 • Use your carpenter's tools to begin work, taking a number of hours listed in the crafting time column. You can make progress in 2 hours increments.
##Bullet
 • For each 2 hour increment, make a crafting check of 1d20 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency with carpenter's tools.
##Bullet
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the construction project is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail three times in a row, the construction project is a failure and all materials are lost.

HARVESTING TREES

##Body text
You can convert trees that are at least 20 feet tall into units of lumber. A 20 foot tall tree will produce 1 unit of lumber, and an additional unit of lumber for each 10 feet of tree height. At your GM's discrection, some trees may not be suitable lumber. It takes 4 hours of work by a laborer to convert trees to units of lumber.

##Body text
A unit of lumber can be converted to 10 common branches

QUARRYING STONE

##Body text
Quarrying Stone is significantly harder and at the edge of what this system attempts to define. As a rule of thumb, if a quarry that can produce stone is available, 1 laborer can produce 1 unit of stone in 8 hours of hard labor (1 unit per day). A laborer with a Strength ability score of 18 or higher can produce twice as much stone in the same time period.

##Body text
Setting up a quarry exceeds the scope of this system, but would take days or weeks.

SUCCESS AND FAILURE

##Body text
After making a crafting roll, if you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item).

##Body text
Checks for Engineering do not need to be immediately consecutive. If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged. Failure means that no progress is made during that time.

##Body text
Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components reserved for that item can only be recovered via salvage.
### Layout: end frame

##Heading 2
LABOR

##Body text
Unlike most crafting, Engineering can encompass large projects that require additional laborers. A laborer can be any creature with a Strength of 12 or higher that can understand you, lift and carry objects, and is willing to work for you for the duration. You can be your own laborer if you fit the requirements. A creature with a Strength of 18 or higher or proficiency with carpenter's tools can count as a skilled laborer, and is worth two laborers. Two creatures of insufficient Strength ability score but with 8 or more Strength ability score working together can be counted as single laborer, but only for 4 hours a day, after which more labor confers a level of exhaustion.

##Body text
Additional labor doesn't inherently speed a project up, though a GM may rule that it is possible in a case by case basis. Checks can be made with insufficient labor as long as you have half the labor pool needed, but each crafting check takes 4 hours in this case.

##Body text
The number of laborers required is based on the scale of the project, as per the following table:

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

##Heading 2
COLOSSAL PROJECTS

##Body text
For colossal projects (projects bigger than Gargantuan), you need one laborer for every additional 10 square feet of the project beyond 40 by 40. For example, to build a bridge that is 200 feet long by 40 feet wide, you would need five times more laborers (20 laborers) to maintain a 2 hour crafting check.

##Body text
Every laborer requires their own set of crafting tools, though they do not need proficiency with them. At a GM’s discretion, mason’s tools or woodcarver’s tools can replace carpenter’s tools for laborers where appropriate.

MINOR BRANCHES

##Body text
Some branches of crafting tend to overlap with the needs of adventurers more than others. The ones that do not are listed here as minor branches. These are no less important to a world and an economy, but provide more basic necessities, materials, and valuable goods. The primary use of these branches of crafting are to produce valuable goods.

##Body text
One common interaction with these branches of crafting is with enchanting-magic has expensive taste, and it might be hard to find, for example, boots worth 250 gp-those are some fancy boots! You can use these branches of crafting to make or calculate how such things might be made.

##Body text
The following provides tool and ability score for each minor branch of crafting, as well as some examples of materials and produced items, but keep in mind that minor branches exist primarily for value added crafting, the provided examples are just reference points (instances) of the value added formula.

##Bullet
 • Beer worth more than 5 gp takes 2 weeks.
##Bullet
 • Achohol takes 3 days, with the 2 checks made at the start, after which the ahcohol can be collected after the brewing time.

Why Weaver’s Tools?

##Body text
Because that’s what the default system has. While I could invent a new tool, as much as possible I want to keep this compatible with the basic system, including backgrounds and proficiency. If a player wants to tailor things and consults the core books, they’ll pick weaver’s tools, so I want that to work as they’d expect

APPENDIX A: CALCULATING NEW ITEMS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
This book is not a book about magic items, and the subject of how to make an item is beyond the scope of the appendix. This appendix will help you figure out how to craft an item you've already made. The first thing you need to know is the rarity of the item and if the item is consumable or not.

Rarity	Difficulty	Time	Estimated Labor Cost
##Body text
Common	8-12	2-8 hours	0.1-16 gp

Legendary	20-25	24-40 hours	2,388-44,140 gp

### Layout: end frame

##Body text
Regardless if the item is consumable or not, it should generally fall into those ranges. Consumable items should fall to the bottom of the range, while more mechanically powerful items should fall into the highest reaches. That the labor cost of an easy to make Legendary Item can be cheaper than Very Rare items is intentional; the range of item cost and difficulty is very wide within rarities, even if the final cost of the item will result in them being ordered by rarity.

##Body text
The next step is to add appropriate reagents of that the appropriate crafting branch of the rarity until you reach the following costs. The easiest way to do this will be to find a similar item that is already built out, and then replace any item that doesn't make sense of your item, or to increase or decrease the cost of the item as appropriate.

ENCHATING & MAGICAL ITEMS

##Body text
The most complicated (and most common) use case is Enchanting. Not only does enchanting use the basic components of its system, it adds an additional element: Scrolls. Scrolls serve as the "magic blueprint" to an item, and replace the rule of recipes or blueprints in the system. If your magic item cast spells... this step is easy. The item takes the scrolls of those spells.

##Body text
If it doesn't, find appropriate allegories to what the item does. The obvious example, is a +1 weapon. It doesn't cast a spell, but it does have the same effect as a magic weapon spell, so it can use that scroll. A bag of holding is more complicated, but you can follow the same logic-the secret chest spell doesn't exactly overlap, but it shares some properties... it's close enough for these purposes.

Experience-based crafting

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
In the olden days crafting checks took experience as a fundamentally component. This is not a feature of this sytem, but the following is a variant for those that want to run a hateful and archaic system that will cause great suffering. In this system, certain components can be (or must, as per your GM), be replaced with experience, using the following ratios:

##Body text
Arcanist Crafting

##Body text
This harkens back to the tales of the Arcanists of certain ancient empires investing their very life force and power in magic items, and somewhat models the system as presented in early editions. I don't necessarily recommend it for 5e, and this isn't how I run crafting, but I wouldn't to present the option here. This will make magic items more of an investment, but easier to access.

##Heading 2
ASSISTANCE

##Body text
Group-based crafting and minions

##Body text
When being assisted by a skilled craftsman (who has proficiency in the related tool and skills of the crafting branch), you gain advantage on the crafting roll.

##Body text
If one roll succeeds, the check passes and the crafting continues as normal. If both of your rolls succeed, it counts as twice as much progress. If both of the rolls would be a failure, it counts as two failures and no progress is made. Too many cooks in a kitchen can be dangerous! More than one helper when crafting this method doesn't have additional benefits.

##Body text
If you are using the "Take 10" approach during downtime crafting, you can pick the most skilled crafter's modifier to the crafting roll to use. Each additional person assisting during downtime crafting, the period crafting time per check is reduced by 1 hour to a minimum of 1 hour (with three helpers). People can only qualify as helpers if they have proficiency in the tool being used for the crafting project.

##Heading 2
ACTUAL BLACKSMITHING

##Body text
Actual blacksmiths have opinions

##Body text
Since posting this system, I've heard from plenty of actual blacksmiths, letting me know blacksmithing is hard. This system is a model that balances game mechanics, fun, practicality, and realism in equal parts, but if you want a system that will make them happier, double all blacksmithing times, and triple armor crafting time per check. This means that making 1 check would for weapons or items would be 4 hours, and making 1 check for armor would take 6 hours.

##Body text
I would recommend only using this variant when downtime is plentiful, or when combined with the "Assistance" variant rules. When combined with the assistance variant rules, the maximum number of helpers remains 3 (each reducing the time to make a check by 1 hour still).

##Heading 2
MORE COMMON MAGIC

##Body text
Not just for enchanters

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
While magical items is generally thought of as the domain of enchanters, a skilled crafter with the correct knowledge may be able to craft certain magic items with this variant rule. If you have proficiency in Arcana, you can use your crafting skill to craft items from certain enchanting tables as per the table below. When making items this way, you can only make items of types you can normally make.

##Body text
If another creature proficient in arcana assists for the full duration of the craft, they can serve as a replacement for proficiency in arcana.

##Body text
Each branch of crafting will have a different way to gain skill in that field, typically involving a variety of options for gaining each level of a skill. These are not intended to be something gained easily or quickly, and scale on a quite exponential scale. Achieving skill 3 or 4 is fairly easy for adventurers, while skill 5 and 6 would be what is achieved at the end game, and level 7 is possible, but out of reach for most adventurers. Here is a simple method of progression:

It is possible that other methods exist, the scroll is fundamentally a blueprint of the magic the item uses, as well part of its magical essence that is imbued into it. A GM can opt to replace the scroll with a blueprint or innovation check (see variant rules) and additional magical essences (to replace both the knowledge and power provided by the scroll).

##Heading 2
VARIANT: RECIPES

##Body text
Materials are just stuff without a recipe. Coming in the form of techniques, blueprints, or any one of a hundred different forms of knowledge, the an essential step of making anything is know how.

##Body text
A recipe alone doesn't inherently grant success-a recipe is just a path that the craftsman can walk, but final product will come down to their skills, materials, and a little luck. Even so, recipes are not created equal. The technique of swordcraft left behind by a grand master of the craft can contain knowledge that will inherently boost the skills of anyone following its techniques.

##Body text
Like materials, recipes can come from three sources.

##Body text
Found: The world you adventure in is often vast and dotted with the legacies of those that have come before. Frequently ancient techniques and secrets can be uncovered during your adventurers, hoarded by dragons (...or maybe kobolds earlier in your adventures!).

##Body text
Purchased: As with most things, money can bridge many gaps and provide many answers. Either convincing a craftsman to teach you their technique or buying a potion formula from the alchemists guild, most people in the world will understand that they stand to more to gain by selling fish than by teaching their customers how to fish, so these will won't come cheap, but can often by attained by establishing good relations... or just dropping a lot of coin.

How Much Do Recipes Cost?

##Body text
How much a recipe costs, or even if it's available, has a lot of factors behind it and is ultimately up to the GM, but in general be fairly expensive (to encourage innovation) but not outrageous compared to what they make. Roughly 10 times the cost of the materials to make the item.
### Layout: end frame

##Body text
Invented: While many craftsmen and craftswoman tread in the footsteps of others, those at the cutting edge are those that innovate and invent, stepping beyond what is known (to them). More difficult, a recipe is created through trial and effort, and will frequently leave many broken prototypes as proof of the effort.

##Body text
To invent a recipe, you make an innovation check. This takes 1 hour, and once attempted cannot be attempted again until you finish a long rest. You can select materials to expend on the innovation check.

##Bullet
 • If you roll half the innovation difficult or more and did not have the correct materials, you learn the materials needed for the recipe (this doesn't require any materials to be expended).
##Bullet
 • If you roll half the innovation difficult or more of the recipe and had the correct ingredients, you learn the innovation difficulty of the recipe and materials needed for the recipe.
##Bullet
 • If you roll the innovation difficult with all the required ingredients spent toward the check, you learn the recipe, and this counts as the first successful crafting roll toward crafting the product of that recipe.
##Bullet
 • On failure, all materials put toward the check are lost. On success, the recipe is learned, and the materials can be rolled over toward crafting the item; the first crafting check for the item automatically succeeds on that crafting attempt.

##Body text
The GM can set the innovation DC of an item, or just have it default to the DC of an innovation check is the Crafting DC of the item +5.

##Body text
An innovation roll is as follows:

##Body text
Recipe Innovation Roll = d20 + your relevant crafting Skill + your Wisdom or Intelligence modifier (your choice)

##Body text
However a player has acquired their recipes, they are encouraged to record their recipes in a book or manual.

##Body text
Losing Your Recipes:

##Body text
Recipes are usually going to be recorded as physical documents, and consequently must be safeguarded. If a set of Recipes are lost, it will be up to the GM to determine how many they might remember by heart.

##Body text
The following is my recommendation: half their recipes + the intelligence modifier are known by heart. Recipes remembered are chosen in the order of Invented Recipes &gt; Most Crafted Recipe &gt; Most Recently Crafted Recipe, and then ordered by which have been used the most to the least.

##Body text
Certain feats or abilities may negate any recipes lost.

GRITTY REALISM

##Body text
For games that move at a more deliberate pace

##Body text
The normal crafting time listed in this book is balanced around a progression of minimal downtime with 8 hour long rests. For games that follow the model of 8 hour short rests and week long long rests offering more downtime, you can still use this system, but may want to consider longer crafting checks.

##Body text
To accomplish this, make each crafting check take 8 hours (four times longer). This maps to one work day per crafting check. In addition:

##Bullet
 • Checks do not have to be subsequent for any crafting branch (including alchemy).
##Bullet
 • Taking 10 for checks takes two consecutive workdays.
##Bullet
 • Gathering checks require one week when gathering from environment.

EXOTIC INGREDIENTS & POTIONS

##Body text
While standard potions are made from curative, reactive, or poisonous ingredients, exotic ingredients have specialized effects. When making a potion from these ingredients, the potions effect is a combination of the effect of the exotic ingredients added.

##Body text
An Exotic Potion (potion brewed entirely from exotic ingredients) doesn't need a recipe and has a crafting time of 1 hour, and a difficulty of the difficulty of all the exotic ingredients used added together, with 1 check needed per exotic ingredient added.

##Body text
An exotic ingredients can be combined with a standard potion by adding the DC of the standard potion to the combined difficulty of the exotic ingredients. This can result in very powerful potions, but will frequently result in unattainable high difficulty to make it work, as adding random new components to potions typically wrecks the effect.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
##Body text
Camp Actions are things you can do during a long rest that make the most of your time-while adventurers need their beauty sleep (well, most of them), there's always a few spare hours during a Long Rest you can spend in one of the following ways to better prepare yourself for the harrowing times to come.

##Body text
A long rest is 8 hours long, and most adventurers need 6 hours of sleep. This leaves 2 hours of light activity in which to take a camp action from the following list.

Some 5e races have unique sleep requirements. They consequently spend less of their time sleeping or sleep in unique ways. They can take the "Take a Watch" action as many times as they have available time for after taking care of whatever resting needs they have, but may take only one other Camp Action while gaining the benefits of a long rest.

TAKE A WATCH

CRAFT

##Body text
An adventurer that takes this action can make 2 hours of progress toward Crafting during a long rest. This progress is made at the end of the long rest. In order to take this action, the adventurer must have the related crafting tools on hand.

##Body text
Requires a campfire, and any Wisdom Perception checks during this time are made with disadvantage.

A special form of the crafting Camp Action that can be taken with cook's utensils. A hearty meal sits better than any trail rations... even when it is cooked from the simplest of ingredients. You and all willing creatures (willing to eat your cooking) regain an additional Hit Die from the long rest when it is finished.

##Body text
If you have proficiency with cook's utensils, creatures regain additional Hit Dice equal to your proficiency bonus.

PREPARE

##Body text
The life of an adventure has many challenges and it is only natural a cautious adventurer would want to prepare for them. Select one ability score to prepare for the upcoming day and perform 2 hours of an activity that hones it for the challenges ahead (you could prepare Strength or Dexterity through stretches or exercises, Intelligence through studying, Wisdom through meditation, etc).

##Body text
After you finish the long rest, you gain a Preparation die, starting at as a d6. Each time you make an ability check related to your chosen ability score, roll the Preparation die and add it to the result. The Preparation die decreases by one step each time it is rolled until depleted (d6, d4, d2, depleted) May require a campfire, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks during this time are made with disadvantage.

##Heading 2
SLUMBER

##Body text
Sometimes a hard day of adventuring deserves a little extra shut eye. Taking this Camp Action is more akin to a camp inaction, and you get the full recommended 8 hours of sleep.

##Heading 2
CRAFTING MAGIC SPELLS

##Body text
Crafting magic is a unique kind of utilitarian magic. Almost always ritual based, it is not intended for use in combat, and comes with some special rules. In most games, crafting magic spells will not count against spells known, but can only be learned by being taught or purchased, perhaps known from a background.

##Body text
These spells exist for GMs to award to players to make it easier to use crafting-they are not required, but help integrate crafting into adventuring, and fulfill a narrative niche. Though these spells are arcane spells that are primarily the domain of Wizards and Inventors, a GM can assign them to any player they would make sense for (for example, perhaps a Cleric who follows a god of craft, creation, or forging).
